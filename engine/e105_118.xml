                    <para>ABOUT BEARING CRUSH AND SPREAD! Bearing shells must fit tightly in the bore. When bearing
                        shells are inserted into the connecting rod and cap, they protrude above the parting line. This
                        protrusion is required to achieve "BEARING CRUSH". Bearing shells are designed with "SPREAD".
                        That is, the width across the open ends are slightly larger than the diameter of the connecting
                        rod bore into which they are assembled, as shown in Figure
                        <hotlnk xrefid="ef1050626">6.26</hotlnk>. This condition is designed into the bearing shell
                        causing it to spread outward at the parting line when "CRUSH" load is applied by tightening the
                        bolts. Some
