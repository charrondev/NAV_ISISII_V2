                        <para>IN CHASSIS SERVICE ONLY - When bearing clearance is checked, the crankshaft will have to
                            be supported and held against the upper main bearing halves to get a correct Plastigage(r)
                            reading. Use a jack at counterweight next to each main bearing being checked to support the
                            crankshaft. Failure to support the crankshaft will result in inaccurate readings.
