                Bring the pressure on the nozzle to 1500 psi (10342 kPa). If there is any leakage from the return,
                collect it. To conserve time, nozzle may be in inverted position. The maximum allowable leakage is 1.0
                cc in one minute at this pressure.

            <para>Excessive leakage at this point can be caused by scratches or poor sealing at the flat lapped surfaces
                of the nozzle body, intermediate plate or valve body. If this possibility has been already eliminated,
                there is excessive clearance between the valve stem and body. This condition necessitates replacement of
                the nozzle.
