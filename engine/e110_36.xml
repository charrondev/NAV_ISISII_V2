            detects and measures the percent opacity of smoke at the exhaust stack. It consists of a control unit, light
            sensor head with adaptors and a long connecting cable which connects the light sensor head to the control
            unit. The unit operates from power supplied by six ni-cad C batteries.
        </para>
        <para>The opacity of smoke is measured by passing exhaust gas between a light source and a sensor which are
            mounted on special adapters which attach to the exhaust stack. Opacity is read directly in percent. The
            opacity reading on this meter represents the amount of light being blocked by the smoke as it passes through
            the sensor head.
        </para>
        <para>The portability of this unit allows smoke measurements to be taken on the road. This enables the
            technician to quickly diagnose an engine performance problem.
        </para>
        <para>INSTALLATION AND OPERATION</para>
        <para>The smoke opacity meter sensor head must be attached to the vehicle's exhaust pipe. Use the appropriate
            adaptor which fits the vehicle's exhaust stack.
