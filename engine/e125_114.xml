        <para>The second step is to measure the resistance of all wiring harness connectors to ground (preferably the
            negative battery cable) to determine if a short to ground condition is present.
            <emph type="bold">It is important that during this test all accessories including the dome light be turned
                off, current flow in the system will affect resistance readings. If the reading is fluctuating greatly,
                disconnect the battery and measure to the negative battery cable.
