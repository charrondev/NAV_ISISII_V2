        <para>Turn the ignition key to the 'ON' position and measure if the expected voltages are present at the
            connector. On circuits with expected voltages, this test will verify the integrity of that circuit. On
            circuits without an expected voltage, this test will determine if that circuit is shorted or miswired to a
            voltage source.

            <para count="1">Signal ground (marked "A" on all engine sensor harness connectors should measure less than

            <para count="1">Sensor signal lines will measure 0 to .25 volts if the circuit is designed to "pull down"
                when disconnected, or a higher voltage (normally 4.6 to 5, or 12 volts) if it is designed as a "pull up
                circuit". A "pull up" signal circuit that measures the expected value normally indicates a good circuit.

            <para count="1">Communication circuits between the Electronic Control Module (ECM) and the Injector Driver
                Module (IDM) are designed to either "pull up" or "pull down". That means that one end of the
                communication circuit is normally at a high or 12 volt level and the signal is created by the low side
                toggling or switching the high side to ground. Communication lines are best diagnosed with the breakout
                box installed and measuring the expected voltage with the key in the "ON" position and the engine off.
