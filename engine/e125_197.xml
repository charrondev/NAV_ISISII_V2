                is connected by circuit 97DE/97AH to ECM terminal #35. For the relay to enable the cranking system,
                voltage at ECM terminal #35 must be 0.1 - 0.6 volts. Note that the ECM switches terminal #35 between 0.1
                - 0.6 volts and battery voltage, to either "enable" or "disable" the Crank Inhibit Relay. The chart in
                the circuit diagram shows terminal voltages for various conditions and vehicle configurations.

                        terminal #35, and the crank system would not engage. Depressing the clutch would cause ECM
                        terminal #35 to switch to 0.1 - 0.6 volts.
