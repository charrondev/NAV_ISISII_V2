        <para>The diaphragm stage of the tandem lift pump draws fuel from the tank and through the fuel strainer.
            Pressurized fuel 4 to 6 psi (28 to 41 kPa) from the diaphragm stage is supplied to the fuel filter. Air
            trapped in the filter is vented back to the tank through an orifice in the regulator block mounted on the
            filter. The orifice is protected from plugging by a wire mesh screen located inside the filter housing.
        </para>
        <para>Fuel in the filter housing passes through the filter element to a standpipe in the center of the filter
            assembly. Clean fuel is then routed to the inlet of the piston stage of the tandem pump.
        </para>
        <para>The piston stage of the tandem pump raises fuel pressure from 4 psi to 40 psi (28 to 276 kPa) to insure
            proper filling of the injectors. Fuel from this stage is divided through steel lines to the back of each
            cylinder head. These lines supply fuel to a gallery drilled in each cylinder head which intersects each
            injector bore in the cylinder head.

        <para>Return fuel from the two fuel galleries is routed through hoses, of a special rubber compound, from the
            front of each head to the pressure regulator located on the side of the filter housing. These hoses provide
            flexibility in the fuel system by absorbing and smoothing pressure pulses from the piston stage of the pump.
        </para>
        <para>The pressure regulator contains a spring loaded valve to control pressure in the fuel galleries to 40 psi
            (276 kPa). Return fuel flows through the regulator and is routed to the fuel tank(s).
