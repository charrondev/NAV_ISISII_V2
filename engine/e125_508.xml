        <step1>
            <para count="1">Verify oil pressure using a known good mechanical gauge and measuring at the oil reservoir
                and at the main oil galley. Oil pressure at both points should be 10 PSI minimum @ low idle and 40 PSI
                minimum @ wide open throttle with the engine at operating temperature.
            </para>
        </step1>

            <para count="1">If the difference between the reading on the reservoir and main galley vary more than 5 PSI,
                swap gauges and recheck, if the reservoir still has a lower reading reservoir is most likely porous,
                replace reservoir.

        <step1>
            <para count="1">Remove and inspect oil cooler and regulator assembly. Oil regulator should be properly
                staked in the oil header housing and the regulator piston should be free to move when pressure is
                applied.

                ). Upon removal of the lube oil pump inspect the mating front cover surface for gouging or deep
                scratching, inspect the oil pump for damage or wear. Measure the "G" rotor to oil pump housing
                clearance. Specification is 0.028" - 0.032" (0.72 - 0.81 mm). Measure from surface of housing to "G"
                rotor dimension. Specification is 0.001" - 0.003" (0..2 - 0.08 mm.)
