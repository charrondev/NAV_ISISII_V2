        <svcprocinfo>
            <para>A Electronic Control Module (ECM) reset occurs when the ECM momentarily "reboots" or is turned off and
                on while the engine is operating. If the condition occurs a single time, the engine will momentarily
                stumble and the ECM will go through a normal key on cycle, including turning the glow plug lamp and glow
                plugs on and will also attempt to validate the accelerator pedal position. If the pedal is not at the
                idle position when this fault occurs, pedal authority will not be allowed by the ECM until the APS is
                released and the engine will idle only.

                            of injectors by removing the connector at the valve cover and attempt to perform the Buzz
                            Test. If the Buzz test can be accomplished with an injector pair disconnected, the high side
                            short to ground has most likely been isolated to the under valve cover harness corresponding
                            to the disconnected injectors.
