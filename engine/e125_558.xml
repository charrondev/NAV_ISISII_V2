        <para>Ohms Law describes the relationship of voltage, current and resistance, and provides us with a formula to
            make calculations as is shown in (

        <para>If any two of the values are known for a given circuit, the missing one can be found by substituting the
            values in amperes, volts, or ohms and solving for the missing value.

        <para>In a typical circuit, battery voltage is applied to a bulb through a 10-amp fuse and a switch (

            ). Closing the switch turns on the bulb.

        </para>
        <para>I = 12V/2 ohms or I= 12 divided by 2 = 6 amperes of current flow.</para>
        <para>The bulb in this circuit operates at 6 amps and is rated to operate at this level. With 12 volts applied,
            the bulb will glow at the rated output level (candlepower rating). However:
        </para>
        <randlist type="bullet">
            <item>
                <para>If the voltage applied is low (low battery), then (the value of E is lower) and current flow will
                    be less and the bulb will glow less brightly.

                <para>Or if the connections are loose, or the switch corroded, the circuit resistance will be greater
                    (value of R will be larger) and the current flow will be reduced and the bulb will glow less
                    brightly.

        <para>Being able to determine voltage drops is important because it provides the following information:</para>
        <randlist type="bullet">
            <item>
                <para>Too high a voltage drop indicates excessive resistance. If, for instance, a blower motor runs too
                    slowly or a light glows too dimly, one can be sure that there is excessive resistance in the
                    circuit. By taking voltage drop readings in various parts of the circuit, the problem can be
                    isolated (corroded or loose terminals for example).
                </para>
            </item>
            <item>
                <para>Too low of a voltage drop, likewise, indicates low resistance. If for instance, a blower motor ran
                    too fast, the problem could be isolated to a low resistance in a resistor pack by taking voltage
                    drop readings.
                </para>
            </item>
            <item>
                <para>Maximum allowable voltage drop under load is critical, especially if there is more than one high
                    resistance problem in a circuit. It is important because all voltage drops in a circuit are
                    cumulative. Corroded terminals, loose connections, damaged wires or other similar conditions create
                    undesirable voltage drops that decrease the voltage available across the key circuit components.
                    Remember our earlier discussion, the increased resistance from the undesirable conditions will also
                    decrease the current flow in the circuit and all the affected components will operate at less than
                    peak efficiency. A small drop across wires (conductors), connectors, switches, etc. is normal. This
                    is because all conductors have some resistance, but the total should be less than 10 percent of the
                    total voltage drop in the circuit.
