            <para>Some of the devices in an electronic control system are not capable of carrying any appreciable amount
                of current. Therefore the test equipment used to troubleshoot an electronic system must be especially
                designed not to damage any part of it. Because most analog meters

                not, it indicates the switch has failed. If, with the switch closed, the light does not illuminate, and
                "jumpering" the switch doesn't cause the light to operate, but "jumpering" the light to ground causes

            <para>The 12-volt test light tests for voltage in a circuit between the point being tested and ground

                If there is no glow in the bulb, the circuit is open and no current is flowing.

            <para>Once a technician becomes familiar with the test light and the brilliance of the bulb in a normal
                circuit, high-resistance circuits can be recognized by the dimming effect that they have on the test
                light bulb. As the current drops in a high-resistance circuit, the bulb will glow less brightly.
                Although using a 12-volt test light cannot be used as a fool-proof test for high resistance, a less than
                normal brilliance of the test light is an indication of circuit high resistance. Further testing will
                verify the condition and locate the cause.

            <para>The 12-volt test light continuity tester depends on the vehicle battery to power the circuit under
                test. Twelve-volt testers are available with a variety of tips to permit touching them to connectors,
                bare wires, insulated wires or even wires within wiring harnesses

                . To check the tester before use, briefly touch the clip to one post of the battery and the other to the
                opposite post. Twelve-volt testers are not sensitive to polarity and can be connected either way.
            </para>
            <para>The 12-volt test light generally has a sharp probe tip so it can be inserted into connector terminals
                or through wire insulation for testing. It is important to keep the probe tip sharp to minimize damage
                to wire insulation. When the test is complete at a particular point, make sure to tape any holes made in
                wire insulation.
