            <title>INJECTION CONTROL PRESSURE SYSTEM OPERATION</title>
            <para>The system utilizes hydraulically actuated electronically controlled injectors to deliver fuel to each
                injector. The hydraulic fluid used to actuate the injectors is engine oil.
            </para>
            <para>Oil is drawn from the oil pan thru the pickup tube by the engine oil pump. The engine oil pump is a
                gerotor type pump driven by the crankshaft. Oil is fed through passages in the front cover to an oil
                reservoir located in the front cover.

                    <hotlnk xrefid="ef1450103">1.3</hotlnk>.
                </emph>
            </para>
            <para>The reservoir makes available a constant supply of oil to a high pressure hydraulic pump mounted to
                the front cover. The high pressure pump is a gear driven swash plate pump. High pressure oil is
                delivered by the high pressure pump to the high pressure oil supply manifold and into oil passages
                machined into the cylinder head.
            </para>
            <para>When an injector is energized, a poppet valve is opened by an electronic solenoid mounted on the
                injector. Oil pressure is allowed to flow into the injector and act on the amplifier piston. When
                injection is ended, the oil pressure on top of the amplifier piston is vented by the poppet valve thru
                the top portion of the injector.
            </para>
            <para>Pressure control in the Injection Control Pressure System is a closed loop. It is controlled by the
                IPR valve (Injection Pressure Regulator), the ICP sensor (Injection Control Pressure) and the strategy
                in the ECM (Electronic Control Module).
            </para>
            <para>ICP pressure ranges from 3447.4 to 20684.2 kPa (500 to 3000 psi). The regulator valve is mounted in
                the high pressure pump and achieves injection control pressure regulation by dumping excess oil into the
                front cover and back to sump.
