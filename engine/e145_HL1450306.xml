        <para>Turn the ignition key to the 'ON' position and measure if the expected voltages are present at the
            connector. On circuits with expected voltages, this test will verify the integrity of that circuit. On
            circuits without an expected voltage, this test will determine if that circuit is shorted or miswired to a
            voltage source.

                <para>Signal return (marked "A" on all engine sensor harness connectors) should measure less than .25
                    volts.

                <para>V Ref should measure 5.00 volts .50 volts. If this is higher or lower than expected, disconnect
                    sensors one at a time to determine if a sensor is biasing the circuit and refer to V Ref procedures.

                <para>Sensor signal lines will measure 0 to .25 volts if the circuit is designed to "pull down" when
                    disconnected, or a higher voltage (normally 4.6 to 5, or 12 volts) if it is designed as a "pull up
                    circuit". A "pull up" signal circuit that measures the expected value normally indicates a good
                    circuit.

                <para>Actuator circuits may be either on/off type circuits (normally 12 volts) or pulse width modulated
                    circuits (12 volts controlled by a % duty cycle).

                <para>Communication circuits between the Electronic Control Module (ECM) and the Injector Driver Module
                    (IDM) are designed to either "pull up" or "pull down". That means that one end of the communication
                    circuit is normally at a high or 12 volt level and the signal is created by the low side toggling or
                    switching the high side to ground. Communication lines are best diagnosed with the breakout box
                    installed and measuring the expected voltage with the key in the "ON" position and the engine off.
