        <para>The unique design of the lubricating oil high pressure relief valve, 552 kPa (80 psi) located in the front
            cover (

            ) and the oil pressure regulating valve [345 kPa (50 psi)], located by the rear oil cooler header (
            <emph type="bold">Figure

            ), extends the life of the engine because it controls the volume and pressure of oil supplied to the engine.
            The volume of oil supplied by the pump is always in excess of what is needed to lubricate the engine. The
            oil high pressure relief valve is located in the front cover and is used to protect the oil cooler and oil
            filter from extremely high pressures encountered during cold starts in cold weather. If oil pressure exceeds
            552 kPa (80 psi) on the valve face, it moves the valve inward allowing oil to travel through the valve and
            back to the oil pan, thus relieving pressure in the lubrication system.
        </para>
        <para>The oil pressure regulator valve is located on the right side of the crankcase, between the oil filter
            header and crankcase. When all points of lubrication within the engine are satisfied, restriction to flow
            causes pressure to build on the valve causing it to move inward. This action allows excess oil to go
            directly back to the oil pan, through the ports uncovered by the movement of the valve.
