                        <para>ABOUT BEARING CRUSH AND SPREAD! Bearing shells must fit tightly in the bore. When bearing
                            shells are inserted into the connecting rod and cap, they protrude above the parting line.
                            This protrusion is required to achieve "BEARING CRUSH". Bearing shells are designed with
                            "SPREAD". That is, the width across the open ends are slightly larger than the diameter of
                            the connecting rod bore into which they are assembled, as shown in Figure
                            <hotlnk xrefid="ef1600626">6.26</hotlnk>. This condition is designed into the bearing shell
                            causing it to spread outward at the parting line when "CRUSH" load is applied by tightening
                            the bolts. Some
