                solenoid bank. At the correct time, the IDM grounds the solenoid through a low-side driver within the
                IDM. When the injector has delivered the proper amount of fuel, the low-side driver is opened and the
                solenoid is denergized.

        <para>Pressure on top of intensifier forces it down along with plunger. Downward movement of plunger pressurizes
            fuel in the plunger cavity and nozzle. When the fuel pressure reaches Valve Opening Pressure (VOP) the
            nozzle valve lifts off its seat and injection begins.
