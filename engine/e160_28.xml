            <para count="1">The pressure of the fuel and spring in the plunger cavity exerts an upward force on the
                plunger and intensifier. As the pressure of the pressurized oil above the intensifier drops, so does the

            <para count="1">The upward force from the pressurized fuel almost instantly becomes greater than the

            <para count="1">With the check still open, the remaining pressure on the fuel pushes a tiny amount of
                additional fuel out the orifice holes. This causes a large pressure drop and fuel nozzle pressure dorps
                below the VOP. Spring tension on the nozzle valve now reseats and injection stops.
