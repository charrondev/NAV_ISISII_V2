            <para>The DT 466E and International(r) 530E (
                <emph type="bold">Figure

                ) are inline six cylinder, four (4) cycle water cooled engines. These engines are equipped with a
                turbocharger, overhead valves, air-to-air intercooled with replaceable valve guides and valve seats for
                both intake and exhaust. The engine is fueled by a direct injection fuel system with Electronic sensors
                and Hydraulically actuated electronically controlled Unit Injectors (HEUI). The firing order is
                1-5-3-6-2-4.
            </para>
            <para>The crankcase has been especially designed to withstand the loads of diesel engine operation and has
                cast water and oil passages. The crankcase also has replaceable wet type cylinder sleeves. Every main
                bearing web has angled, drilled holes which are fitted with jet tubes that direct lube oil, under
                pressure, to the underside of each piston to help dissipate heat.
            </para>
            <para>The crankshaft is forged steel with induction hardened journals and undercut fillets. It is supported
                on seven precision insert bearings. The camshaft is supported on four pre-reamed bushings and is gear
                driven from the crankshaft. The end thrust of the camshaft is controlled by a thrust flange located
                between the front camshaft journal and the cam gear. Valve lifters have roller followers which provide
                excellent camshaft and lifter durability. This helps minimize engine noise.
            </para>
            <para>The tee pee style connecting rod is constructed of forged steel. It is attached to the crankshaft, one
                per journal. The pistons are cast aluminum alloy and are fitted with two compression rings and one oil
                ring. The piston pin is a free floating type permitting the pin to move or float freely in the piston
                and connecting rod and is held in place with pin retaining rings.
            </para>
            <para>A gerotor type lube oil pump is mounted to the front cover. The pump is driven directly by the
                crankshaft at engine speed. All models are equipped with an oil cooler. The oil cooler has a single
                spin-on type oil filter. There is also a spin-on type coolant filter. The fuel system has a single
                spin-on type fuel filter and a pre strainer assembly attached to the fuel filter header. There is no
                external oil piping with the exception of the air compressor, turbocharger, and high pressure pump
                piping to cylinder head.
