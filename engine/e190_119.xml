        <para>Turn the ignition key to the 'ON' position and measure if the expected voltages are present at the
            connector. On circuits with expected voltages, this test will verify the integrity of that circuit. On
            circuits without an expected voltage, this test will determine if that circuit is shorted or miswired to a
            voltage source.

            <para count="1">Signal return (marked "A" on all engine sensor harness connectors) should measure less than
                .25 volts.

                one at a time to determine if a sensor is biasing the circuit and refer to V Ref procedures (
