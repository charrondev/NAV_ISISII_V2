            for the split - shot fuel system flow.
        </para>
        <para>The diaphragm stage of the tandem lift pump draws fuel from the tank and through the fuel strainer.
            Pressurized fuel 4 to 6 psi (28 to 41 kPa) from the diaphragm stage is supplied to the fuel filter. Air
            trapped in the filter is vented back to the tank through an orifice in the regulator block mounted on the
            filter. The orifice is protected from plugging by a wire mesh screen located inside the filter housing.
        </para>
        <para>Fuel in the filter housing passes through the filter element to a standpipe in the center of the filter
            assembly. Clean fuel is then routed to the inlet of the piston stage of the tandem pump.
        </para>
        <para>The piston stage of the tandem pump raises fuel pressure from 4 psi to 70 psi (28 to 483 kPa) to insure
            proper filling of the injectors. Fuel from this stage is divided through steel lines to one end of each
            cylinder head. These lines supply fuel to a gallery drilled in each cylinder head which intersects each
            injector bore in the cylinder head (

            ).
            <emph type="bold"></emph>Check valves prevent fuel from draining out of the galleries. This enables the
            engine to start easily after shutdown periods. There are no return lines from the galleries on this system.
        </para>
        <para>The pressure regulator contains a spring loaded valve to control pressure in the fuel galleries to 70 psi
            (483 kPa). Return fuel flows through the regulator and is routed to the fuel tank(s).
