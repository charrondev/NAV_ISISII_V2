            <title>Purpose</title>
            <para>To determine if the crankcase and oil reservoir contain engine oil of sufficient quantity and quality
                to enable the injection control pressure system to function properly.

            <title>Test Procedure</title>
            <step1>
                <para count="1">Park vehicle on level ground. Check oil level with oil level gauge. If there is no oil
                    or very little oil in the crankcase the fuel injectors will not operate.
                </para>
            </step1>
            <para>If the oil level on the gauge is over full, it is possible the engine was incorrectly serviced or fuel
                is diluting the oil and filling the crankcase. If a substantial amount of fuel is in the oil, it will
                have a fuel odor.
            </para>
            <step1>
                <para count="1">Inspect oil for color. A milky white oil indicates possible coolant contamination and
                    will have an ethylene glycol odor.
                </para>
            </step1>
            <step1>
                <para count="1">Check service records for correct oil type and viscosity for the temperature
                    (environment) the vehicle is operating in. Single weight or 15W 40 oil is not recommended for cold
                    ambient temperatures. Oil that has had extended drain intervals will have increased viscosity
                    (become thicker) and will make engine cranking more difficult and starting less reliable at
                    temperatures below freezing. Refer to the lube oil chart in the operator's or service publications
                    for the correct oil selection for temperature conditions.
                </para>
            </step1>
            <step1>
                <para count="1">The oil level in the oil reservoir should be checked. Remove the inspection plug in top
                    of reservoir

                    </emph>
                    to check oil level. Normal oil level is within 1/2 inch below the top of the reservoir. (If the
                    engine has not been operated for some time, oil in the reservoir may drain into the crankcase. The
                    engine may start hard or start and not continue to run.) Filling the reservoir will allow the system
                    to prime faster facilitating starting.
                </para>
            </step1>
            <para>If the oil level in the reservoir becomes low while the vehicle is parked for a short period of time,
                it is due to a leaking check valve in the high pressure pump.
            </para>
            <para>If oil level in the reservoir drops while cranking the engine, it indicates that no oil is being
                pumped to the reservoir.
