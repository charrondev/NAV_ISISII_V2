                <para>When it is not cost-effective to completely disassemble and recondition the turbocharger, a
                    replacement core assembly is available for service. When using this unit, it is only necessary to
                    remove the compressor and turbine housings from the old unit and install them on the new core
                    assembly. BE SURE CORRECT ALIGNMENT IS ACHIEVED SINCE THE CENTER HOUSING ON THE NEW CORE ASSEMBLY
                    WILL NOT HAVE ALIGNMENT MARKS.
