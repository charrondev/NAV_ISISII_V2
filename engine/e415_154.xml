                    <para>The best way to clean the crankcase during engine overhaul is in a chemical bath or "HOT
                        TANK". This removes all carbonous material and mineral deposits which collect in the cooling
                        passages. If the "HOT TANK" is not available, use the following cleaning procedure.

                        <para>Oil gallery cup plugs are 13/16" in diameter. Occasionally, engines are built with
                            oversized galleries requiring 7/8" cup plugs. These plugs can be identified by a diamond
                            with an MP stamped on it. When replacing these cup plugs, be sure to determine if the plug
                            is a standard 13/16" or an oversize 7/8". Refer to the Parts Catalog for the correct service
                            number.
