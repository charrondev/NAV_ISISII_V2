            <title>New Main Bearing Cap Fitting Procedure for Service</title>
            <para>A crankcase can usually be salvaged even if a main bearing cap has been damaged. Replacement main
                bearing caps are available for service. The bore of these caps is finish machined, which eliminates the
                need of line boring after installation. However, the face and sides of the caps must be modified to the
                dimensions of the old cap to assure a perfect fit in the crankcase. Enough material has been left on the
                face and sides of the caps to allow for this modification.
