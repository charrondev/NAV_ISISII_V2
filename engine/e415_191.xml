                        <para>Whenever the oil pump housing is removed from the crankcase front cover, be careful not to
                            mix the six oil pump housing bolts with any other hardware. These bolts have a nylon patch
                            mounted in the threads to seal through-tapped holes which go into the oil cavity behind the
                            crankcase front cover. Installation of cap screws not so equipped will result in oil leaks
                            around these cap screws. The leaks will not be obvious until after the engine has been put
                            back into service. To prevent the possible loss of the bolts' sealing characteristic, the
                            prevailing torque bolts should not be reused more than three times.
