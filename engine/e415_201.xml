                <para>Current style coolant filter header disassembly is only required when external valve leakage is
                    present (which indicates the need for O-Ring replacement) or when leakage is found during coolant
                    filter replacement. When the shut-off valve is in the "OFF" position and coolant leaks past the
                    valve, this indicates the need for coolant shut-off valve sleeve replacement.
