        <title>OPERATION</title>
        <para>The thermostat is used to direct coolant flow in the cooling system so engine coolant temperature may be
            controlled. The thermostat is located in a thermostat housing attached to the cylinder head. The housing is
            arranged to return coolant to the radiator or to bypass the radiator and direct coolant to the water pump.
        </para>
        <para>In the cold position (thermostat closed), coolant from the engine is routed through the center of the
            thermostat and into the bypass passage where it is returned to the water pump. Refer to
            <emph type="bold">Figure

            .
        </para>
        <para>When the coolant is at a temperature greater than 82&#176; C (180&#176; F), the thermostat starts to open,
            becoming fully open at 94&#176; C (202&#176; F). In the hot position (thermostat open), the thermostat port
            opens to allow coolant to flow to the radiator, at the same time the thermostat reduces flow through the
            bypass passage. Refer to
            <emph type="bold">Figure

            . A small amount of coolant always flows to the deaeration tank.
