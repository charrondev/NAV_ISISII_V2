                <note>
                    <para>The superior strength of the crankshaft is due to the induction hardening process of the
                        bearing journals and fillets. This localized hardening greatly increases the bending strength of
                        the crankshaft; in order to maintain this strength, special precautions must be taken when
                        regrinding the shaft. If special precautions are not taken, the crankshaft can be severely
                        weakened. The metallurgical characteristics of the shaft demand exacting standards and control
                        when regrinding journals. However, it can be reground locally where equipment and experience can
                        produce quality standards outlined in the following instructions.

                be used to rough or fine dress the face or radii of the wheel. The radii should blend evenly into the

            <para count="1">The selection of the grinding wheel is important because too hard a wheel will increase the
                possibility of burning. An aluminum-oxide wheel with a grit size of approximately 50 and a maximum
                hardness of M will produce satisfactory results, with other conditions being suitable.

            <para count="1">The coolant must be such that it minimizes burning. This requires a fluid with high
                lubricity properties. The straight-cutting oils appear to be the best for grinding crankshafts and are

            <para count="1">In addition to inspecting the dimensional tolerances, the crankshaft must also be carefully
                checked for surface defects, particularly for grinding cracks and burns. It is advisable to spray check
                the crankshaft (using dye penetrant methods) after grinding and lapping to insure that there is no
                surface cracking.
