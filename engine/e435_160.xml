            <para count="1">Fill the crankcase with 16 qts. (15.1 L) w/filter change (or 15 qts. [14.2 L] without filter
                change) of oil meeting the API (American Petroleum Institute) categories of both SG and CF-4 or CE
                (SG/CF-4 or SG/CE) and having Military Specification MIL-L-46152E and MIL-L-2104E approval. Do NOT use
                oils labeled as SG or CF-4 or CE only, as they could cause piston ring sticking or excessive valve train
                wear. Fleetrite Heavy Duty 30 Engine Oil is the preferred viscosity grade for 7.3 L diesel engines
                operating where the temperature will not be colder than +3O&#176; F (-1&#176; C). When temperatures are
                expected to consistently remain below +30&#176; F (-1&#176; C) and above 0&#176; F (-18&#176; C) before
                the next oil change interval, SAE 15W-40 should be used for improved oil flow and cold starting. Refer
                to Chart 1. Shaded areas in Chart 1 indicate the preferred oil for the expected temperature range. CD
                engine oils should only be used when CF-4 or CE oils are NOT available in viscosity grades such as ,
                5W-30 and 10W-30, which are required for low temperature engine operation.
