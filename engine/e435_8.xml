                <para>However, if lube oil filter is not changed every 6000 miles (9656 km), 200 hours or 2 months
                    (whichever comes first), filter contamination will cause a pressure drop due to high restriction.
                    When such contamination occurs, the bypass valve will open and lube oil will "bypass" the filter to
                    be distributed to the engine.

        <para>Under normal conditions, lube oil flows through the oil filter element and oil pressure regulator valve
            (on the clean side).
        </para>
        <para>Five cross passages distribute filtered oil to vertical passages which feed the crankshaft main bearings,
            camshaft bearings and two tappet galleries. The piston cooling jets are fed from the same passage as the
            hydraulic roller cam followers.
        </para>
        <para>The connecting rod bearings are fed from the main bearings via drilled passages in the crankshaft. The
            timing gears are lubricated by oil splash. Oil passes through the hydraulic tappet rollers and up the hollow
            pushrods to lubricate the rocker arm assemblies and valve stems.
