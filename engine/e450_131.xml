            <para>The dual element air cleaner provides a large primary (outer) filter element and a optional small
                secondary (inner) filter element. The secondary element should be used in dusty environments such as
                dump and mixer applications.

                is located between the primary and the secondary element in the bottom of the air cleaner housing. This

                mounted vacuum gauge. THE INNER ELEMENT IS NOT RECORDED ON THE RESTRICTION INDICATOR OR DASHMOUNTED

                    <para>A low air cleaner restriction reading or a lack of movement by the air cleaner restriction
                        indicator could be caused by a plugged sintered fitting. There are two different types of this
                        fitting (Figure
                        <hotlnk xrefid="ef4500634">6.34</hotlnk>). The first fitting has a filter screen in the fitting.
                        This screen can become plugged and not allow a correct air cleaner restriction reading to be
                        taken. If this type of fitting is found, drill center of screen with a 1/32" size drill. This
                        fitting is welded in place and is not a serviceable part. The other type of fitting has a 0.020
                        in. (0.51mm) orifice fitting. This type of fitting can be easily cleaned with a fine piece of
                        wire. Reworking the first type fitting and cleaning the second type fitting before running
                        diagnostic tests will eliminate false air cleaner restriction readings.
