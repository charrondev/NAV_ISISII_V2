                        <para>A low air cleaner restriction reading or a lack of movement by the air cleaner restriction
                            indicator could be caused by a plugged sintered fitting. There are two different types of
                            this fitting (Figure
                            <hotlnk xrefid="ef4500518">5.18</hotlnk>). The first fitting has a filter screen in the
                            fitting. This screen can become plugged and not allow a correct air cleaner restriction
                            reading to be taken. If this type of fitting is found, drill center of screen with a 1/32"
                            size drill. This fitting is welded in place and is not a serviceable part. The other type of
                            fitting has a 0.020 in. (0.51mm) orifice fitting. This type of fitting can be easily cleaned
                            with a fine piece of wire. Reworking the first type fitting and cleaning the second type
                            fitting before running diagnostic tests will eliminate false air cleaner restriction
                            readings.
