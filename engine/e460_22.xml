        <para>DESCRIPTION</para>
        <para>The manometer (Figure
            <hotlnk xrefid="ef4600408">4.8</hotlnk>) is a "U" shaped tube with a scale mounted between the legs of the
            "U". Where the portability of the Model-200 is not required, this manometer can be used to measure either
            low pressure or vacuum and may be filled with water.

        <para>FILLING</para>
        <para>When filling the manometer with water, use only good drinking water without additives except for some
            colored water vegetable dye which enables the tester to read the scale easier. With both legs of the
            manometer open to the atmosphere, fill the tube until the top of the fluid column is near the zero mark on
            the scale. Shake the tube to eliminate any air bubbles.

        <step1>
            <para count="1">Support the manometer in a vertical position. Be sure the fluid is at the zero mark on the
                scale.
            </para>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">Connect one leg of the manometer to the source of the pressure or vacuum. Be sure the other
                leg is open to atmosphere.
            </para>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">Start the engine and when the engine is in the proper operating condition as specified in
                Performance Data Guideline pages, observe the manometer.
            </para>

        <step1>
            <para count="1">After about two minutes, record the average position the fluid level is above and below the
                zero mark. Add the two figures together. The sum of the two is the total column of fluid.

                <note>
                    <para>At times both columns of the manometer will not travel the same distance. This is of no
                        concern to the tester as long as the leg not connected to the pressure or vacuum source is open
                        to the atmosphere.
