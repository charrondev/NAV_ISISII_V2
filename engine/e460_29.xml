                            indicator spud is not a serviceable part, thus a restriction requires that it be reworked by
                            drilling a 1/32" size hole through the center. Reworking will eliminate false air cleaner
                            restiction readings. DO NOT ALLOW DRILLING DEBRIS TO ENTER THE INTAKE MANIFOLD. Refer to
