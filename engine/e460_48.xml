                <para>THE 7.3 LITER FUEL INJECTION PUMPS FOR INTERNATIONAL(r) 1000, 3000, 4000, S-SERIES AND METRO II
                    APPLICATIONS, AND FORD MOTOR COMPANY E &#38; F SERIES APPLICATIONS ARE TIMED IDENTICALLY AT THE
                    FACTORY. HOWEVER, DYNAMIC TIMING SPECIFICATIONS FOR SERVICE ARE DIFFERENT DUE TO DIFFERENT TIMING
                    METERS USED BY INTERNATIONAL AND FORD. EACH METER HAS DIFFERENT ELECTRONIC CIRCUITRY AND FILTERING
                    WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR THE DIFFERENT SERVICE DYNAMIC TIMING SPECIFICATIONS. THE DYNAMIC TIMING
                    SPECIFICATION LISTED ABOVE IS VALID ONLY WHEN USING THE TACH-N-TIME (ZTSE-4142). OTHER TIMING METERS
