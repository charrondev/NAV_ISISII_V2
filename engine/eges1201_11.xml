            <para>The function of the fuel system is to deliver fuel from the fuel tank(s) through a filter to the fuel
                injectors at a regulated pressure. On 1994-1996 model year engines, the system also returns warm fuel to
                the fuel tank(s). The fuel injectors use the pressure from the lube oil to pressurize the fuel and
                inject it into the combustion chambers.
            </para>
            <para>The fuel system consists of the following components:</para>

            <para>The diaphragm stage of the tandem lift pump draws fuel from the tank through a fuel strainer located
                on the fuel filter housing. Fuel is then delivered to the fuel filter under low pressure of less than 67
                kPa (10 psi). Air that is trapped in the filter is vented back to the tank through an opening (or hole)
                in the regulator block mounted on the filter housing. This opening is protected from plugging by a wire
                mesh screen located inside the filter housing.
            </para>
            <para>On some engines, the base of the filter housing contains an electric heating element that is used to
                warm fuel. Heating helps prevent the fuel from waxing during cold weather. Also located in the base of
                the housing is a sensor to detect the presence of water in the fuel (optional). When sufficient water
                has collected in the bottom of the filter, the sensor will illuminate a "water in fuel" lamp located on
                the instrument panel.
            </para>
            <para>Fuel in the filter housing passes through the filter element to a standpipe in the center of the
                filter assembly. Clean fuel then passes to the inlet side of the piston stage located on the tandem
                pump.

            <specpara>
                <note>
                    <para>The fuel filter element is attached to the threaded filter cover. When servicing, the element
                        can be separated from the cover and replaced with a new element. Fuel flow will be interrupted
                        without the fuel filter element in place. The standpipe in the center of the housing contains a
                        shut off valve that is open only when the filter element is in place.

            <para>The piston stage of the tandem pump raises fuel pressure to ensure proper filling of the fuel
                injectors. Fuel from this stage is delivered to one end of each cylinder head. These lines supply fuel
                to a gallery drilled in each cylinder head.

                Return fuel from the two galleries is routed through hoses of a special rubber compound from the front
                of each cylinder head to the pressure regulator valve on the side of the filter housing. These hoses
                provide flexibility in the fuel system by absorbing and smoothing pressure pulses from the piston stage
                of the pump .

                These engines are equipped with the split shot fuel injectors. A fuel inlet check valve is used in each
                cylinder head. The inlet check valve dampens the pulses in the fuel rail in the cylinder head. There are
                no return lines from the galleries on this system .
            </para>
            <para>The pressure regulator contains a spring loaded valve to control pressure in the fuel galleries.
                Return fuel flows through the regulator and is routed back to the fuel tank(s), however, no fuel is
                returned to the fuel tank(s) from the cylinder heads with split shot fuel system flow.
