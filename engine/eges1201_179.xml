                <para>When lubricated with clean engine oil, the rod nuts must thread onto the connecting rod studs by
                    hand. If excessive resistance is felt, clean the connecting rod threads and try a new nut. If the
                    new nut does not thread on freely, the connecting rod bolt must be replaced. Failure to do so may
                    result in engine damage.
