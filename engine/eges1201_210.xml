                <para>To avoid serious personal injury or possibly death, use caution to avoid burns when dealing with
                    hot coolant and objects. Use heat resistant gloves and wear appropriate eye protection.

                <para>When servicing the thermostat, it is essential that the thermostat opens fully at the specified
                    temperature. A thermostat that functions properly will reduce the risk of engine damage caused by
                    overheating.

            </caution>
            <note>
                <para>Only genuine INTERNATIONAL&#174; thermostats ensure proper coolant flow and positive sealing
                    characteristics. INTERNATIONAL thermostats are required to provide proper engine cooling. Make sure
                    the thermostat is a INTERNATIONAL thermostat that has the correct temperature range.
                </para>
                <para>Two different thermostats available for this engine model. One has a "START-TO-OPEN" temperature
                    of 89&#176;C (192&#176;F) and a "FULL-OPEN" temperature of 104&#176;C (219&#176;F). The other has a
                    "START-TO-OPEN" temperature of 82&#176;C (179&#176;F) and a "FULL-OPEN" temperature of 95&#176;C
                    (203&#176;F).
