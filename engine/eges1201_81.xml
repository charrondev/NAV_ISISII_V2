            <para>A poor quality grind cannot be corrected by lapping. Inspect each valve for seat dimensions and make
                any necessary corrections. Corrections should always be made on the seat, not the valve face. If the
                recession is excessive, install a new cylinder head. If the valve protrudes above the deck, grind the
                valve seat.
