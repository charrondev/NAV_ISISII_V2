            <geninfo>
                <para>The turbocharger is an exhaust driven centrifugal air compressor. Its purpose is to increase power
                    output by supplying compressed air to the engine. The internal components are oil and air cooled.
                    Engine oil is circulated through the housing which acts as a heat barrier between the "hot" turbine
                    and the "cold" compressor. The bearings are sleeve-type and are lubricated by engine oil. Oil is
                    pumped directly from the crankcase and circulated in the turbocharger housing. Then the oil is
                    returned to the sump through an oil drain in the turbocharger mounting pedestal.
                </para>
                <specpara>
                    <note>
                        <para>There are no external oil inlet or drain tubes for the turbocharger. Oil is exchanged via
                            machined passages in the crankcase and the turbocharger mounting pedestal.
                        </para>
                    </note>
                </specpara>
                <para>High velocity engine exhaust gases drive the turbine shaft assembly at rates up to 130,000 rpm.
                    Filtered air entering the compressor side of the turbocharger is compressed and delivered to the
                    engine intake manifold at a pressure greater than atmospheric pressure. Because more air is
                    delivered to the intake manifold, the net result is more power, improved fuel efficiency, and the
                    ability to maintain power at higher altitudes.
                </para>
                <para>Some engines are equipped with an optional exhaust back pressure (EBP) device. This control device
                    helps bring the engine up to its normal operating temperature at an increased rate. The device
                    increases the engine's heat production by controlling a butterfly valve in the exhaust outlet
                    housing. When the valve is restricted, the exhaust back pressure increases, causing the engine to
                    work harder in order to force out exhaust gases. The net result is that the engine warms up at a
                    much faster rate. When the valve fully opens, the exhaust gas flows out unrestricted.
