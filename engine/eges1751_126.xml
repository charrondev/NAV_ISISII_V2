            <para>The ECM will control engine speed to maintain a constant road speed with cruise control. Depressing
                the SET switch when the vehicle is at the desired speed with the cruise switch in the ON position
                activates the cruise control. Speed is increased or decreased by depressing Accel or Coast. The cruise
                control is deactivated by depressing the OFF switch, brake pedal, clutch pedal or on vehicles equipped
                with automatic transmissions by placing the transmission in neutral.

            <para>Engine speed can be controlled by the Speed Control Command Switches (SCCS) if the PTO option has been
                programmed in the ECM and the vehicle is stationary. Variable as well as preset speeds are available
                depending on programming. The PTO function is turned ON by switching the Cruise switch ON. Depressing
                the Set/Coast or Resume/Accel switch will increase or decrease speed depending on PTO programming.

            <para>Cruise control allows the ECM to control engine power delivery to maintain a constant speed. The speed
                set point is determined by the driver; however, high and low set points are programmed in the ECM. These
                are the cruise high set limit and cruise low set limit. Also the minimum engine speed at which the
                cruise control can be engaged is programmed in the ECM.

            <para>Placing the cruise control ON/OFF switch ON supplies 12V to ECM pin 35 to enable the cruise control.
                When the ON/OFF switch is ON , it supplies the voltage for the Set/Resume switch. Depressing the Set
                switch will supply a 12V signal at ECM pin 32 to engage the cruise control. If cruise is active, it will
                cause the set speed to decrease (coast). If the cruise is not active, cruising speed will be set at the
                current vehicle speed. Depressing the Resume switch will supply a 12V signal to ECM pin 31, reactivating
                the cruise set speed to the last active set speed. If the cruise is active, depressing the resume
                (accel) switch will cause the set speed to increase.

                Preset. This allows the operator to select one of two preprogrammed values for engine speed. To operate,
                turn the On/Off switch to the ON position. This sends a 12V signal to pin 35 of the ECM. Then depress
                either the Set or Resume switch. Depressing the Set switch sends a 12 volt signal to pin 32 of the ECM.
                This will cause the engine speed to run at the value programmed into PTO Set Speed.

                speed range.

            <para>To enable, turn the On/Off switch to the ON position. This sends a 12V signal to pin 35 of the ECM.
                Speed may be adjusted two ways. First the operator may adjust the engine speed with the accelerator and
                then depress the Set switch. This sends a 12V signal to pin 32 of the ECM. Or the operator may depress
                the Resume/Accel, sending a 12V signal to pin 31 of the ECM to increase the speed incrementally. In
                addition the operator may depress the Set/Coast switch to decrease engine speed.

                the vehicle can be moving while the mode is active. See In Cab Variable for more details. The maximum
                speed of the vehicle is programmable up to 20 MPH. Disabling this mode is the same as In Cab Variable,
                however, a speed signal will not disable the speed control until the preprogrammed maximum speed is
                achieved.

            <para>Before troubleshooting make sure that the batteries are fully charged. Check battery connections and
                grounds for clean, tight connections free of damage. Voltage tests will give misleading results if the
                batteries are not fully charged.

            <para>Before troubleshooting inspect circuit connectors for pushed back, loose or damaged (spread or bent)
                terminals, or wires with cut strands, etc. Wires and connections must be free of damage or corrosion.
                When some connectors corrode, a light white residue will be present that must be removed.
