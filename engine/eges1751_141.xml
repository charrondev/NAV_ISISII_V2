            <title>Key-On Engine-Running Injector Test</title>
            <para>The injector Scuff test is designed to detect problems with injection and combustion events.
                Performing a cylinder contribution test will analyze the individual contribution of each of the power
                cylinders. Its
                <emph type="bold">primary function</emph>
                is to detect a bad injector, although it will also detect problems that could affect the overall
                performance of the power cylinders (i.e.: valves, push rods, pistons, rings, etc.). Further diagnostic
                testing may be necessary to resolve mechanical issues.
            </para>
            <para>During this test the ECM will control fuel delivery and determine each cylinder's power contribution.
                If a cylinder is not performing satisfactorily, a Diagnostic Trouble Code may be set.

                <para count="1">The ECM increases fuel delivery to cylinder No.1 (over-fuels) which causes engine speed

            <step1>
                <para count="1">The ECM decreases fuel delivery to cylinder No.1 (under-fuels) which causes engine speed

                <para>If the difference is not what the ECM expects, a DTC may be set for an under-contributing
                    cylinder. The procedure will repeat for the remaining cylinders (in numerical order) until the test
                    is complete.

                    <para>During the cylinder contribution test, the fuel rate graph represents fuel delivery to the
                        remaining 5 cylinders.

            <para>The cylinder contribution test begins with cylinder No.1 (front cylinder) and is performed
                sequentially. The rpm fluctuation on engines with more than one severely scuffed injector can be enough
                to stop the cylinder contribution test.
