                    <para>This above formula states that current flow (I) = voltage (E) applied to a circuit divided by
                        total resistance of (R) in the circuit. This shows that an increase in voltage or a decrease in
                        resistance increases the current flow.

                    <para>High voltage drops indicate excessive resistance. For example, if a blower motor runs too
                        slowly or a light glows too dimly, the circuit may have excessive resistance. Voltage drop
                        readings can isolate problems in parts of a circuit (corroded or loose terminals for example).

                    <para>Maximum allowable voltage drop under load is critical, especially for more than one high
                        resistance problem. All voltage drops in a circuit are cumulative. Corroded terminals, loose
                        connections, damaged wires or other similar conditions create undesirable voltage drops that
                        decrease the voltage available across the key components in the circuit. Increased resistance
                        will decrease current flow in the circuit, preventing other components to operate at peak
                        efficiency. A small drop across wires (conductors), connectors, switches, etc. is normal,
                        because all conductors have some resistance, but the total should be less than 10 percent of the
                        total voltage drop in the circuit.
