        <title>AMMETER</title>
        <para>An ammeter measures current flow (amperage) in a circuit. Amperes are units of electron flow that indicate
            how many electrons are passing through the circuit. Ohm's Law shows that current flow is equal to the
            circuit voltage divided by total circuit resistance. Since amps (I) is the current in the circuit,
            increasing voltage also increases the current level (amps). Also, any decrease in resistance (ohms) will
            increase current flow (amps).
        </para>
        <para>At normal operating voltage, most circuits have a characteristic amount of current flow, known as current
            draw. Current draw can be measured with an ammeter. Referring to a specified current draw rating for a
            component (electrical device), measuring the current flow in the circuit, and comparing the two (the rating
            versus the actual measurement) can provide valuable diagnostic information.

        </figure>
        <para>An ammeter is connected in series with the load, switches, resistors, etc. so that all of the current
            flows through the meter. The ammeter measures current flow only when the circuit is powered and operating.
            Before measuring current flow, determine approximately many amps are in the circuit to correctly connect the
            meter. The DMM is fused to measure up to 10 amps using the 10A connection point.
        </para>
        <para>The estimate of current flow can easily be calculated.

            Resistance of the light bulb is 2 ohms. Applying Ohm's law, current flow will be 6 amps (6A = 12V / 2 ohms).
            If the fuse is removed and an ammeter is installed with the switch closed, 6 amperes of current will be
            measured flowing in the circuit. Notice that the ammeter is installed in series so that all the current in
            the circuit flows through it.

            <warning>
                <para>To avoid personal injury, always make sure the power is off before cutting, soldering or removing
                    circuit components prior to inserting the DMM for current measurements. Even small amounts of
                    current can be dangerous.
                </para>
            </warning>
        </specpara>
        <para>Excessive current draw means that more current is flowing in a circuit than the fuse and circuit were
            designed for. Excessive current draw will open fuses and circuit breakers. Excessive current draw can also
            quickly discharge batteries. An ammeter can diagnose these conditions.
        </para>
        <para>Reduced current draw will cause a device (electric window motor for example) to operate poorly. Increased
            circuit resistance causes lower current flow (often loose or corroded connections).
