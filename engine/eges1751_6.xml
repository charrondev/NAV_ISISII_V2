        <para>The Injection Control Pressure Regulator valve is a pulse width (duty cycle %) controlled valve. The pulse
            width is modulated between 8 and 60% to control ICP pressure in the range of 500 to 3000 psi (3.4 to 20
            MPa). The regulator is mounted in the high pressure oil pump and maintains desired injection control
            pressure by dumping excess oil through an (internal shuttle) spool valve into the front cover and back to
            the oil pan.
        </para>
        <para>As the demand for injection control pressure increases, the ECM increases the pulse width (duty cycle %)
            over the IPR solenoid. This action forces the poppet against the drain orifice increasing the pressure
            behind the spool valve.
        </para>
        <para>As oil pressure increases behind the spool valve, it moves forward and blocks the drain ports on the sides
            of the IPR valve. Refer to IPR Higher Injection Pressure. As demand for injection control pressure
            decreases, the ECM decreases the (duty cycle %) over the solenoid allowing oil to drain out of the drain
            orifice. This action is accomplished by relieving the pressure behind the spool valve which allows it to
            partially open the relief port decreasing injection control pressure. Refer to IPR Lower Injection Pressure.
            .
        </para>
        <para>The described operation allows the IPR to continuously adjust injection control pressure when commanded by
            the ECM.
