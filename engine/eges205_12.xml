            <title>Operation</title>
            <para>The injection control pressure system utilizes a hydraulically actuated injector to pressurize fuel
                inside the injector. The hydraulic fluid used to actuate the injector is engine oil.
            </para>
            <para>Oil is drawn from the oil pan through the pick up tube by the engine oil pump. The engine oil pump is
                a gerotor type pump driven by the crankshaft. At start-up, oil is fed through passages in the front
                cover to an oil reservoir mounted on top of the front cover. Once the engine is running, oil is supplied
                through the left lifter oil gallery.
            </para>
            <para>The reservoir makes available a constant supply of oil to a high pressure hydraulic pump mounted in
                the engine "V." The high-pressure pump is a gear driven seven plunger swash plate pump. High pressure
                oil is delivered by the high pressure pump, through high pressure oil lines, to oil galleries machined
                into the cylinder heads. Drilled intersecting passages supply high-pressure oil to the fuel injectors.
            </para>
            <para>This high-pressure oil is utilized by the Hydraulically actuated Electronically controlled Unit
                Injectors (HEUI) when the solenoid is energized to pressurize and atomize the fuel into the combustion
                chamber. After injection is complete, the solenoid is de-energized and the oil inside the injector is
                vented through the top portion of the injector, splashed on the valve train and allowed to drain back
                into the oil pan.
            </para>
            <para>The injection control pressure system is a closed loop operating system that consists of the
                electronic control module (ECM), injection control pressure (ICP) sensor and injection pressure
                regulator (IPR) valve.
            </para>
            <para>The ECM is programmed with an injection pressure control strategy which determines the correct
                injection control pressure at all engine operating conditions. The ECM receives a 0 - 5 volt (DC) analog
                feedback signal from the ICP sensor located in the high pressure oil supply gallery on the left cylinder
                head that indicates injection control pressure. The ECM processes this signal and controls injection
                control pressure by controlling the ground to the IPR valve.

            </figure>
            <para>The ECM controls the injection control pressure by operating the IPR valve. The result of this control
                is continuously monitored by the ECM using the ICP sensor. The pressure signal obtained from the ICP
                allows the ECM to know the actual injection control pressure at all times of engine operation, even
                during cranking mode. This operation is known as "Closed Loop."
            </para>
            <para>Diagnostic codes can be set by the ECM if the ICP electrical signal is out of range or if the ICP
                signal received corresponds to an out of range value for the injection control pressure at a given
                operating condition.
            </para>
            <para>Should any of these occur, the ECM will ignore the ICP signal and control the IPR valve operation from
                previously programmed default values. This condition is known as an "Open Loop."
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>IPR Valve Operation</title>
            <para>The IPR valve is a pulse width (duty cycle %) modulated valve operating at 400 Hz. The pulse width is
                modulated between 8 and 60% to control ICP pressure. The regulator is mounted in the high pressure pump.
                The regulator maintains the desired injection control pressure by dumping excess oil through an internal
                spool valve. The excess oil then travels, through an internal stand pipe, into the front cover and back
                to the oil pan.
            </para>
            <para>As the demand for injection control pressure increases, the ECM increases the pulse width (duty cycle
                %) over the IPR solenoid. This action forces the poppet against the drain hole, thereby increasing the
                pressure behind the spool valve.
            </para>
            <para>As oil pressure increases behind the spool valve, it moves forward and blocks the drain ports on the
                sides of the IPR valve.
            </para>
            <para>When the demand for injection control pressure decreases, the ECM decreases the pulse width (duty
                cycle %) over the solenoid allowing oil to drain out of the drain hole. This is accomplished by
                relieving the pressure behind the spool valve. This reduction in pressure allows the spool valve to
                partially open the relief port, decreasing the injection control pressure.
            </para>
            <para>The described operation allows the IPR to continuously adjust the injection control pressure commanded
                by the ECM.
