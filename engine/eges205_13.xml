        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Description</title>
            <para>The fuel injector is a unitized fuel injector that is hydraulically actuated and electronically
                controlled.
            </para>
            <para>Hydraulic actuation is accomplished when the injector solenoid is energized, opening a poppet valve
                and allowing ICP pressure to flow on top of the amplifier accumulator.
            </para>
            <para>Fuel is supplied to the injector by passages drilled through the cylinder head that intersect fill
                ports in the injector.
            </para>
            <para>The area under the plunger is filled with fuel from pressure supplied by the transfer pump. As the
                plunger moves down, the increase in pressure closes the fuel inlet check ball. Pressure continues to
                rise until the nozzle valve pressure setting is overcome. Fuel is pressurized through the nozzle
                orifices and atomized into the combustion chamber. Injection is terminated when the solenoid is
                de-energized and ICP pressure is released.

            <para>
                <emph type="bold">Solenoid</emph>
            </para>
            <para>The solenoid is a very fast acting electromagnet that, when energized, pulls the poppet valve off its
                seat.
            </para>
            <para>
                <emph type="bold">Poppet Valve</emph>
            </para>
            <para>The poppet valve is held on its seat by a spring. In this closed position, high pressure inlet oil is
                blocked and the intensifier cavity is opened to drain.
            </para>
            <para>When the solenoid is energized, the poppet is quickly lifted off its seat. The passage to the drain is
                closed and the inlet for high pressure oil is opened.
            </para>
            <para>
                <emph type="bold">Intensifier Piston and Plunger</emph>
            </para>
            <para>When the poppet valve opens the inlet port, high pressure oil enters the injector and acts on the top
                of the intensifier piston. Pressure builds on the intensifier, pushing it and the plunger down. The
                intensifier is seven times larger in surface area than the plunger. This difference allows for an equal
                multiplication of force. The downward movement of the plunger pressurizes the fuel in the plunger
                cavity, causing the nozzle to open.

                <caption>Stages of Injector Operation</caption>
            </figure>
            <para>The injection cycle is executed in two stages. Some fuel is pre-injected into the combustion chamber
                to initiate the combustion. Following combustion initiation, the primary injection takes place. This
                feature reduces emission levels during light load operations. It also reduces light load engine noise.
            </para>
            <para>The barrel and plunger were redesigned and a spill port was incorporated. When injection is initiated,
                the first shot of fuel is pre-injected into the combustion chamber. Pre-injection is complete when the
                spill port of the plunger coincides with the slot on the barrel.
            </para>
            <para>At this time, some fuel is allowed to return to the fuel supply port until the spill port slot is once
                again blocked by the plunger and the primary injection stroke takes place.
