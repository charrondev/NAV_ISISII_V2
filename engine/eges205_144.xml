                <para>This engine uses hydraulic valve lifters with roller followers. Therefore, a lifter guide is
                    needed to maintain proper roller-to-cam lobe orientation. Normal clearance between hydraulic valve
                    lifter and guide allows slight tracking of the roller across the cam lobe.
                </para>
                <para>The tracking of a hydraulic valve lifter roller is a normal characteristic as the roller
                    accelerates and decelerates during typical engine operation. Consequently, a typical wear pattern on
                    the cam lobes will exhibit tracks from side to side and will have wide and narrow areas from the
                    loading and unloading of the follower. The visual wear pattern (tracking) is normal. It does not
                    require camshaft replacement.
