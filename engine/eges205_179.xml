                    <item>
                        <para>On engines equipped with the older style connecting rod, be sure the nuts on connecting
                            rods thread onto the connecting rod studs by hand. If excessive resistance is felt, clean
                            the connecting rod studs and try a new nut. If the new nut does not thread on freely, the
                            connecting rod must be replaced. Failure to do so may result in engine damage.

                        <para>On engines equipped with the newer style connecting rod, the connecting rod bolts should
                            be checked for binding. The bolts should thread into the connecting rod freely when
                            lubricated with clean engine oil. If they do not the connecting rod must be discarded.
                            Connecting rod threads cannot be re-tapped if bonding exists. Check thread condition
                            carefully during inspection. Failure to do so may result in engine damage.
