        <para>Bearing shells must fit tightly in the bore. When bearing shells are inserted into the connecting rod and
            cap, they protrude slightly above the parting surface. This protrusion is required to achieve a
            <emph type="bold">bearing crush</emph>.
        </para>
        <para>Across the open ends, bearing shells are slightly larger than the diameter of the connecting rod bore into
            which they are assembled. This condition is designed into the bearing shell, causing it to spread outward at
            the parting line when a bearing crush load is applied by tightening the nuts. Some snap may be lost in
            normal use, but bearing replacement is not required because of a nominal loss of snap.
        </para>
        <para>When the assembly is drawn up tight, the bearing is compressed, ensuring a positive contact between the
            backside of the bearing and the machined surface of the connecting rod bore.

                    clearance is not achieved, a problem with the crankshaft may still exist. Regrinding the crankshaft
                    and using undersize bearings are probably necessary.
                </para>
                <para>Also, the bearing cap bolt torque is very important. Use a torque wrench that is known to be
                    accurate. Repeat the running clearance check procedure before condemning the crankshaft.
