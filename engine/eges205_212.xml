                <para>When servicing the thermostat, it is essential that the thermostat opens fully at the specified
                    temperature. A thermostat that functions properly will reduce the risk of engine damage caused by
                    overheating.

            <note>
                <para>Only genuine INTERNATIONAL&#174; thermostats ensure proper coolant flow and positive sealing
                    characteristics. INTERNATIONAL&#174; thermostats are required to provide proper engine cooling. Make
                    sure the thermostat is a INTERNATIONAL&#174; thermostat that has the correct temperature range.
