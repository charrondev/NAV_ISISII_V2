                <para>The engine will not run without the filter element in place. Failure to secure the fuel cap to the
                    fuel filter may result in engine damage because the filter element is required to open the valve in
                    the center stand pipe. When the valve is open, fuel is allowed to flow into the filter. This feature
                    protects the injectors from contaminants if the filter element is left out.

                <para>If the fuel system has been drained, prime the fuel filter by filling the filter housing up to the
                    cap threads with clean diesel fuel.
