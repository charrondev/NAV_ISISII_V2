                <para>Different shapes of pedestals are used on the T 444E engines. The service kit CAN NOT be used on
                    engines having S/N 843990 - 1825359 and using hourglass-shaped pedestals. If oil is leaking from the
                    EBP piston rod housing on these pedestals, the entire pedestal assembly must be replaced with P/N
                    1831455C92.
                </para>
                <para>Hourglass pedestals are still being used on some engines built after S/N 1825359. The service kit
                    can be used on those later engines.

                <para>Turbocharger assembly P/N 1831774C93 already uses the new EBP piston rod assembly and can be
                    serviced with this kit. The turbocharger part number is located on the identification tag attached
                    to the turbocharger compressor housing.
