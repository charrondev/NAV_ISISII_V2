            <title>Description</title>
            <para>The function of the cooling system is to keep the engine within a designated temperature range. Major
                components of most cooling systems include a radiator and fan combination with a water pump, thermostat,
                oil cooler, and coolant filter. The water pump is a belt-driven centrifugal type, which is set into the
                front cover.
            </para>
            <para>The front cover incorporates two separate passages. One passage channels coolant from the water pump
                to the crankcase. The other passage is a bypass that routes coolant back to the water pump when the
                thermostat is closed. The thermostat starts to open at 89&#176;C (192&#176;F) and is fully open at 104&#176;C
                (219&#176;F).
            </para>
            <para>Coolant flows from the bottom of the radiator into the inlet tube of the water pump, and into the
                front cover. Coolant is pushed by the impeller in the water pump, through an internal passage in the
                front cover, and out into the crankcase. An internal passageway in the crankcase directs coolant from
                the front to the rear, evenly distributing coolant around the cylinders and into the cylinder heads.
            </para>
            <para>Coolant leaves the cylinder head in the following two ways:</para>
            <randlist type="bullet">
                <item>
                    <para>The coolant is directed, via an internal passage in the crankcase, to the oil cooler header.
                        Coolant flows through passages in the oil cooler and exists at the water pump, to be mixed with
                        incoming coolant from the radiator.
                    </para>
                </item>
                <item>
                    <para>Coolant exists from the cylinder head, flows through an internal passage in the crankcase, and
                        into the front cover. It is then directed to the water pump passage containing the thermostat.
                    </para>
                </item>
            </randlist>

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Thermostat Operation</title>
            <para>The thermostat incorporates two outlets that work independently to channel coolant to two different
                parts of the engine. One outlet carries coolant to the radiator, the other outlet directs coolant back
                to the water pump.
            </para>
            <para>When the engine coolant temperature is below the specified thermostat opening temperature, the outlet
                to the radiator is thermally blocked. This blockage forces coolant to flow through the bypass passage
                back into the water pump. As the engine approaches its normal operating temperature, the thermostat
                opens, closing off the bypass passage and allowing coolant to flow towards the radiator.
