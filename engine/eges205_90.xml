                    <para>To avoid engine damage, all of the O-rings and seals on the fuel injector should be replaced
                        anytime the fuel injector is removed. When removing or installing the O-rings and seals, be
                        careful not to scratch the seal grooves of the fuel injector body. Use a non-metallic tool (wood
                        or plastic) to remove the seals away from the grooves. Failure to do so could result in fuel or
                        oil dilutions.

                    <para>To avoid engine damage, when installing the O-rings and seals onto the fuel injectors, make
                        sure all O-rings and seals are located at the top of the grooves to prevent them from rolling
                        during installation. Also, make sure the O-rings and seals do not twist during installation.
                        Failure to do so could result in fuel or oil dilution.
