            <para>The cooling system keeps the engine within a designated temperature range. Major components of cooling
                systems include a radiator and fan combination with a coolant (water) pump, thermostat, oil cooler, and
                coolant filter (if equipped). On these engines, the water pump is a belt-driven centrifugal type, which
                is set into the front cover.
            </para>
            <para>This front cover incorporates two separate passages. One passage to channel coolant to the crankcase
                from the water pump, the other is a bypass to route coolant back to the water pump when the thermostat
                is closed. The thermostat starts to open at 88 &#176;C (190 &#176;F) and is fully open at 100 &#176;C
                (212 &#176;F).
            </para>
            <para>Coolant flows from the bottom of the radiator into the inlet tube of the front cover and into the
                water pump. The coolant is pushed by the impeller of the water pump, through an internal passage in the
                front cover and out to the crankcase.
