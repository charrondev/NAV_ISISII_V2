            <para>The connecting rod is constructed of forged steel. It is attached to the crankshaft, one per journal.
                The pistons are cast aluminum alloy or steel crown with an aluminum skirt. All pistons are fitted with
                two compression rings and one oil ring. The piston pin is a free floating type, permitting the pin to
                move or float freely in the piston and connecting rod, and is held in place with pin retaining rings.
