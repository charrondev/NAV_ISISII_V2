                <title>About Bearing Crush and Spread</title>Bearing shells must fit tightly in bore. When bearing
                shells are inserted in connecting rod and cap, they protrude above paring line. This protrusion is
                required to achieve "Bearing Crush."

            <para>Bearing shells are designed with "Spread." That is, width across open ends are slightly larger than
                diameter of connecting rod bore in which they are assembled. This condition is designed in bearing
                shell. By inserting crankshaft, it pushes the bearing downward in the bore thus forcing the bearing ends
                inward.
