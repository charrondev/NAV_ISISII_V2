            <title>Description</title>
            <para>The fuel injector is a unitized fuel injector that is hydraulically actuated and electronically
                controlled.
            </para>
            <para>Hydraulic actuation is accomplished when the injector solenoid is energized opening a poppet valve and
                allowing ICP pressure to flow on top of the amplifier and accumulator piston.
            </para>
            <para>Fuel is supplied to the injector by passages drilled through the cylinder head that intersect with
                fill ports in the injector. The area under the plunger is filled with fuel from pressure supplied by the
                supply pump. As the plunger moves down the increased pressure closes the fuel inlet check ball. Pressure
                continues to rise opening the nozzle valve, fuel is pressurized through the nozzle orifices and injected
                into the combustion chamber.
            </para>
            <para>Injection is terminated when the solenoid is de-energized and ICP pressure is released.</para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Solenoid</title>
            <para>The solenoid is a very fast acting electromagnet, which when energized, pulls the poppet valve off its
                seat.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Poppet Valve</title>
            <para>The poppet valve is held on its seat by a spring. In this closed position, high-pressure inlet oil is
                blocked and the intensifier cavity is opened to drain. When the solenoid is energized, the poppet is
                quickly lifted off its seat. The path to drain is closed and the inlet for high-pressure oil is opened.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Intensifier Piston and Plunger</title>
            <para>When the poppet valve opens the inlet port, high-pressure oil enters the injector and acts on the top
                of the intensifier piston. Pressure builds on the intensifier, pushing it and the plunger down. The
                intensifier is seven times larger on the International&#174; DT 466E, and six times larger on the
                International&#174; 530E, in surface area than the plunger; providing an equal multiplication of force.
                The downward movement of the plunger pressurizes the fuel in the plunger cavity, causing the nozzle to
                open.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Nozzle Assembly</title>
            <para>The nozzle assembly is of conventional design with the exception of the fill check. This check ball
                seats and seals during the downward stroke of the plunger to prevent leakage of the high-pressure fuel.
                During the return stroke, it unseats allowing the plunger cavity to fill. The nozzle valve is an
                inwardly opening type which lifts off its seat when pressure overcomes the spring force. Fuel is then
                atomized at high-pressure through the nozzle tip.
