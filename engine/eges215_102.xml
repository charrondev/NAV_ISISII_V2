            <para>The red ENGINE lamp is turned on when conditions are present that will cause impending damage to the
                engine. The level of protection is dependent on which Engine Warning And Protection Systems (EWPS) are
                turned on in the ECM. See Extended Description.
            </para>
            <para>The ECM does not monitor the EWPS system for faults. Requests by the ECM to turn on the red ENGINE
                lamp on the dash are sent over the Power Train Data Link. There are no Diagnostic Trouble Codes for this
                system.

            </para>
            <para>This group of parameters customizes the engine warning and protection feature. The engine warning and
                protection system safeguards the engine from undesirable operating conditions in order to prevent engine
                damage and to prolong engine life. When a warning condition is detected, the on-board electronics will
                illuminate the red ENGINE lamp.
            </para>
            <para>When a critical condition is detected, the on-board electronics will shut down the engine if the
                engine warning and protection system has its protection features enabled. After an engine shutdown, the
                operator may restart the engine for a thirty second run time if desired.
            </para>
            <para>The event logging feature will also record when an excessive (i.e., critical) engine event has
                occurred in both engine hours and odometer readings. There are four states of Engine Warning and
                Protection.
