            <para>The ECM will control engine speed to maintain a constant road speed with cruise control. Depressing
                the set switch when the vehicle is at the desired speed with the Cruise button in the ON position
                activates the cruise control. Speed is increased or decreased by depressing Accel or Cruise buttons. The
                cruise control is deactivated by depressing the OFF switch, applying the brake pedal, clutch pedal, or
                on vehicles equipped with automatic transmissions, by placing the transmission in neutral.

            <para>Engine speed can be controlled by the SCCS switches if the PTO option has been programmed into the ECM
                and the vehicle is stationary. Variable as well as preset speeds are available depending on ECM
                programming. The PTO function is turned ON by switching the cruise button ON. Depressing the Set/Cruise
                or Resume/Accel button will increase or decrease engine speed depending on PTO programming.

            <para>If the engine does not respond to the cruise control switches, use the cab electronics diagnostic
                software to monitor cruise switch input to the ESC. If the switch state does not change when the
                steering wheel cruise controls are depressed, diagnose the cruise switch circuits using the S08250 -
                Electrical Troubleshooting Guide - 4200/4300/4400. If the ESC is receiving the cruise switch input, use
                the electronic engine diagnostic software (Master Diagnostics) to view the cruise switch state. If the
                switch state does not change as the switch is depressed, verify communication exists between the ECM and
                the ESC (does the ECM respond to other ESC inputs). If the switch state does change, verify that other
                conditions do not exist that would stop or delay the reaction to the input. Examples include:

            <para>Cruise control allows the ECM to control the engines power delivery to maintain a constant vehicle
                speed. The speed set point is determined by the driver, however high and low set points are programmed
                in the ECM. These are the cruise high set limit and cruise low set limit. Also the minimum engine speed
                at which the cruise control can be engaged is programmed in the ECM. See Cruise Control, Body Builder
                Connections Circuit Diagram .

            <para>PTO speed control allows an operator to set a fixed engine speed, either in the cab or remotely.
                In-cab PTO uses the same switches on the steering wheel as are used for cruise control. Remote PTO uses
                switches that are installed by a body builder and are wired to the vehicle's wiring harness at the "body
                builder's connections." There are two features that utilize the PTO speed controls. Remote Accelerator
                Pedal and Electronic Pressure Governing. See RPS and EPG in this section of manual.

            <para>In-Cab Preset is selected by programming the ECM programmable parameters for In-Cab Mode to In-Cab
                Preset. This allows the operator to select one of two programmed values for engine speed. To operate,
                turn the ON/OFF switch to the ON position. Then depress either the Set or Resume switch. This will cause

                in this mode the vehicle can be moving while the mode is active. See In-Cab Variable for more details.
                The maximum speed of the vehicle is programmable up to 20 m.p.h. This mode is the same as In-Cab
