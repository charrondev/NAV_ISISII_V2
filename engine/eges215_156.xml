        <title>AMMETER</title>
        <para>An ammeter is used to measure current flow (amperage) in a circuit. Amperes are units of electron flow,
            which indicate how many electrons are passing through the circuit. Ohm's Law indicates that current flow in
            a circuit is equal to the circuit voltage divided by total circuit resistance. Since amps (I) is the current
            in the circuit, increasing voltage also increases the current level (amps). Also, any decrease in resistance
            (ohms) will increase current flow (amps).
        </para>
        <para>At normal operating voltage, most circuits have a characteristic amount of current flow, referred to as
            current draw. Current draw can be measured with an ammeter. Referring to a specified current draw rating for
            a component (electrical device), measuring the current flow in the circuit, and comparing the two (the
            rating versus the actual measured) can provide valuable diagnostic information.
        </para>
        <para>An ammeter is connected in series with the load, switches, resistors, etc. so that all of the current
            flows through the meter. The meter will measure current flow only when the circuit is powered and operating.
            Before measuring current flow, we need to know approximately how much current will be present to properly
            connect the meter. The DMM is fused to measure up to 10 amps using the 10A connection point.
        </para>
        <para>The estimate of current flow can easily be calculated. In the following image Installing The Ammeter , the
            resistance of the light bulb is 2 ohms. Applying Ohm's law, we can calculate that current flow will be 6
            amps (6A = 12V / 2 ohms). If we remove the fuse, and install the ammeter as shown, with the switch closed we
            will measure 6 amperes of current flowing in the circuit. Notice that the ammeter is installed so that all
            the current in the circuit flows through it. The ammeter is installed in series.

                <para>To avoid personal injury, always make sure the power is off before cutting, soldering or removing
                    circuit components prior to inserting the DMM for current measurements. Even small amounts of
                    current can be dangerous.

        </specpara>
        <para>Excessive current draw means that more current is flowing in a circuit than the fuse and circuit were
            designed for. Excessive current will open fuses and circuit breakers. Excessive current draw can also
            quickly discharge batteries. An ammeter is useful to help diagnose these conditions. On the other hand,
            there are times reduced current draw will cause a device (electric window motor for example) to operate
            poorly. Remember increased circuit resistance causes lower current to be available to the device. Loose or
            corroded connections can frequently cause this problem.
