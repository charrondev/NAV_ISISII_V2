        <svcprocinfo>
            <para>The ohmmeter is used to measure resistance (ohms) in a circuit. Like the ammeter and voltmeter, there
                are both analog and digital meters available. It is recommended that the Fluke 88&#8482; (DMM) be used.
                See ELECTRONIC CIRCUIT TESTING in this section.

            <specpara>
                <caution>
                    <para>The ohmmeter can only be used on circuits when the power has been removed. The meter contains
                        its own low voltage power supply and the power from 12-volt systems may damage the meter.
                    </para>
                </caution>
            </specpara>
            <para>Ohmmeters use a small battery to supply the voltage and current which flow through the circuit being
                tested. The voltage of the meter battery and the amount of current flow in the circuit are used with
                Ohm's law and the meter calculates the circuit resistance which is displayed by the meter. With the
                Fluke 88&#8482; (DMM), range selection and meter adjustment are not necessary.

            <title>Measuring Resistance</title>
            <para>Resistance measurements determine:</para>
            <randlist type="bullet">
                <item>

            </randlist>
            <para>To measure the resistance of a component or a circuit, power must first be removed from the circuit.
            </para>
            <para>The component or circuit that is to be measured must be isolated from all other components or circuits
                so that meter current (from probe to probe) only flows through the desired circuit or component or the
                reading will not be accurate. If we wanted to measure the resistance of the load, most of the current
                flow from the meter would flow through the indicator lamp because it has less resistance. To measure the
                load, one connector to the load should be removed. It is not always apparent when a component must be
                isolated in such a manner, so it is a good practice to isolate the circuit or component by physically
                disconnecting one circuit.
            </para>
            <para>The ohmmeter leads are then placed across the component or circuit and the resistance will be
                displayed in ohms (&#x2126;) . When checking a sensor or variable resistor such as fuel level gauge,
                heating the element or moving the arm should move the meter through a range of resistance that can be
                compared to a specification.

            <title>Checking for Open Circuits</title>
            <para>Electrical circuits can be checked for opens using an ohmmeter. The circuit must first be disconnected
                from the power supply. The circuit to be checked must also be isolated from other circuits. Connect the
                meter to the open ends of the circuit as shown . A high reading (infinity) indicates there is an open in
                the circuit. A near zero reading is an indication of a continuous circuit. Notice in the same
                illustration the circuit between the light and the ground is disconnected. This precaution prevents
                reading a circuit as complete that may be shorted to ground ahead of the load device.

            <title>Checking for Short Circuits</title>
            <para>Checks for short circuits are made similarly to checks for open circuits. However, the circuit to be
                checked must be isolated from both the power source and the ground point.
            </para>
            <para>Connecting the ohmmeter as shown in between an isolated circuit and a good ground point will allow
                checking the circuit for a short to ground. A short to ground will be indicated by a near zero reading,
                while a circuit not shorted to ground will cause the meter to read very high. With the Fluke 88&#8482;
                (DMM), an open circuit will read
                <emph type="bold">OL</emph>
                (over limit) on the meter display.
