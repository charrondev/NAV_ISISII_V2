        <para>The fuel supply pump draws fuel from the fuel tanks to the fuel strainer. Fuel flows through the strainer
            to the supply pump. The supply pump increases fuel pressure to approximately 65 psi (448 kPa). Pressurized
            fuel is pumped through the fuel filter to the fuel supply manifold for distribution through passages in the
            head to the fuel injectors.
        </para>
        <para>The fuel rail pressure is controlled to 65 psi (448 kPa) by a Fuel Pressure Regulator mounted to the rear
            of the fuel manifold. After the pressure regulator, excess fuel is returned to the tanks.
        </para>
        <para>In the injectors the fuel pressure is increased to injection pressures of approximately 18,000 psi (124
            MPa).
