        <title>IPR Valve Operation</title>
        <para>The Injection Control Pressure Regulator valve is a pulse width (duty cycle %) controlled valve. The pulse
            width is modulated between 8 and 60% to control ICP pressure in the range of 3.4 to 20 MPa (500 to 3000
            psi). The regulator is mounted in the high pressure oil pump and maintains desired injection control
            pressure by dumping excess oil through an (internal shuttle) spool valve to the front cover and back to the
            oil pan.
        </para>
        <para>As the demand for injection control pressure increases, the ECM increases the pulse width (duty cycle %)
            to the IPR valve. This forces the poppet against the drain orifice increasing the pressure behind the spool
            valve.
        </para>
        <para>As oil pressure increases behind the spool valve, it moves forward and blocks the drain ports on the sides
            of the IPR valve. Refer to IPR Higher Injection Pressure . When the demand for injection control pressure
            decreases, the ECM decreases the (duty cycle %) to the IPR valve allowing oil to drain out of the drain
            orifice. This is accomplished by relieving the pressure behind the spool valve which allows it to partially
            open the relief port decreasing injection control pressure. Refer to IPR Lower Injection Pressure .
        </para>
        <para>The described operation allows the IPR to continuously adjust injection control pressure as commanded by
            the ECM.
