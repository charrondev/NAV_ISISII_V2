        <para>Turn the ignition key on. Plug the breakout tee into the harness and measure voltage at each pin with a
            digital multimeter (DMM). Compare meter readings with the expected voltages listed in the diagnostic
            section. If the tee is not available, use the appropriate tool from the terminal test adapter kit
            (ZTSE4435). Do not probe the connector terminals with the DMM leads directly. This test will determine if
            that circuit is shorted or incorrectly wired to V

            and signal circuits should measure greater than 1000 ohms. The control side of an actuator will measure
            greater than 1000 ohms, but the expected reading on the other circuit of the actuator will depend upon what
            the control side was switching, power or ground. If the ECM was switching the ground, "low side driver,"
            then the other circuit of the actuator should measure greater than 1000 ohms from the connector terminal to
            battery ground. If the ECM is switching the B+ side, "high side driver," the ground circuit will measure
            less than 5 ohms from terminal to battery ground, .

        <para>Harness resistance is checked when a circuit is suspected of having high resistance or being open. Perform
            this test by connecting a breakout box to the ECM end of the harness and measuring resistance from the pin
            of the breakout tee to the pin on the breakout box. Circuit wires should have a resistance of less than 5
            ohms.
