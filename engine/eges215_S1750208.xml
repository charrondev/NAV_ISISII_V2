            <para>The CMP (Camshaft Position) sensor is a Hall Effect type sensor that generates a digital frequency as
                windows on the timing disk pass through its magnetic field. Engine speed is determined by counting 24
                windows on the timing sensor disk each camshaft revolution. The position of cylinder 1 is determined by
                distinguishing a narrow vane on the camshaft timing sensor disk.

                Engine torque and fuel is controlled and is dependent on engine speed. Fuel quantity is determined by
                engine speed.

            <para>An inactive CMP signal during cranking is detectable by the ECM. An inactive CMP signal will cause a
                no start condition. Electrical noise can also be detected by the ECM, if the level is sufficient to
                effect engine operation a corresponding Diagnostic Trouble Code will be set.

            </para>
            <para>The International engine control system includes a Camshaft Position Sensor (CMP). This sensor
                provides the Electronic Control Module (ECM) with a signal that indicates camshaft position and engine
                speed.
            </para>
            <para>The CMP sensor signal is used by the ECM to synchronize piston position to injector firing sequence.
                The injector firing order sequence begins when the ECM detects the narrow vane on the timing disk
                indicating the position of number 1 cylinder. Engine position for each cylinder is then continuously
                calculated as each vane on the timing disk passes by the CMP sensor. This information is processed by
                the ECM and used for injection timing and fuel delivery control. The ECM can then initiate the beginning
                of firing.
            </para>

                <emph type="bold">Operation</emph>
            </para>
            <para>The Camshaft Position Sensor is a Hall Effect type sensor that generates a digital frequency as
                windows on the timing disk pass through the magnetic field. The frequency of the windows passing by the
                sensor as well as the width of selected windows allows the ECM to detect engine speed and position. When
                the narrow vane passes the CMP sensor, the signal on time is less than when the other vanes pass the
                sensor. This produces a signal that the ECM uses to indicate engine position.
            </para>
            <para>Engine speed is detected by the ECM by counting the frequency of the 24 signal pulses for each
                camshaft revolution.

            </para>
            <para>Once the ECM has recognized the narrow vane (wide window) it will synchronize the engine firing order
                to the timing of the CMP signal. Every 2 crankshaft revolutions it will verify that synchronization. If
                the ECM receives too many or too few pulses for the number of engine revolutions, it will set a
                Diagnostic Trouble Code.
            </para>
            <para>The engine will not operate without a functioning CMP signal. However, the ECM will attempt to
                determine the cause of an invalid signal and identify it with a Diagnostic Trouble Code. CMP codes that
                are set will become inactive codes if the key is turned off.

            <para>Code 143 indicates the ECM has received CMP signals with the wrong number of transitions. This

                pulses from the sensor. When this problem is continuous, the engine will stop running and the ECM will
                log an active code. If the key is shut off, the code will become an inactive code. This code will not

            <para>Code 144 may be due to: Poor ground connections for CMP or other electronic components. Wire harness
                shielding missing or incorrectly installed on the engine harness. Outside components that could induce

            <para>Diagnostic Trouble Code 612 indicates that the ECM has monitored the CMP signal and the signal is

            <para>Possible causes: ECM has been accidently replaced with an incorrect ECM for the particular engine
                application. For example, the timing disk for the I-6 and the V-8 (T 444E) are dissimilar, with each
                generating a distinctive signal. The ECM from the V-8 (T 444E) engine will not run an I-6 engine and
                vice-versa. Incorrect signal due to a defective CMP sensor or incorrect air gap between the CMP sensor
                and the timing disk.
