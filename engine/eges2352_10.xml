            <title>Fuel Pump</title>
            <para>The power steering and fuel pump assembly draws fuel from the tank(s) through an 80 micron fuel
                prescreen element and transfers pressurized fuel to the fuel filter housing. The fuel pump raises fuel
                pressure to insure proper filling of the fuel injectors.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Fuel Filter Housing</title>
            <para>Fuel in the filter housing passes through a 10 micron fuel filter cartridge to a standpipe in the
                center of the filter assembly, and then clean fuel passes through fuel supply lines to a machined
                gallery in each cylinder head.
            </para>
            <para>The base of the fuel filter housing contains an electric heating element (optional) used to warm the
                fuel. This helps prevent fuel from waxing during cold weather operation. An optional Water In Fuel (WIF)
                sensor, in the base of the housing, detects water in the fuel. When water accumulates in the bottom of
                the fuel filter housing, the WIF sensor sends a signal to illuminate an amber colored WATER IN FUEL lamp
                in the instrument panel.

            <title>Pressure Regulator</title>
            <para>The pressure regulator contains a spring loaded valve to control pressure in the fuel galleries.
                Return fuel flows through the regulator and is routed to the fuel tank(s).
