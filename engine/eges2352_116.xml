                <para>Bearing shells must fit tightly in the bore. When bearing shells are inserted into the connecting
                    rod and cap, they protrude above the parting line. This protrusion is required to achieve "bearing
                    crush."
                </para>
                <para>Bearing shells across the open ends are slightly larger than the diameter of the connecting rod
                    bore into which they are assembled. This condition is designed into the bearing shell, causing it to
                    spread outward at the parting line when "bearing crush" load is applied by tightening the bolts.
                    Some snap may be lost in normal use, but bearing replacement is not required because of a nominal
                    loss of snap.

                <para>When the assembly is drawn up tight, the bearing is compressed, assuring a positive contact
