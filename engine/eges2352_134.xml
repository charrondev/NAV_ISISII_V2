                    <para>This engine uses hydraulic valve tappets with roller followers; therefore, a roller follower
                        guide is needed to maintain correct orientation of roller to cam lobe. Normal clearance between
                        the valve tappet roller and guide allows for slight tracking of roller across cam lobe.
                    </para>
                    <para>Tracking of the roller is normal when the roller accelerates and decelerates during engine
                        operation. Consequently, a typical wear pattern on cam lobes will exhibit tracks from side to
                        side, have wide and narrow areas from the loading, and unloading of the follower. The wear
                        pattern (tracking) is normal and the camshaft does not require replacement.
