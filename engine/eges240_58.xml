            <para>Combustion leaks can be identified by combustion gas observed in engine coolant deaeration tank. The
                most probable cause of combustion gas leakage to the cooling system is past injector or glow plug sleeve
                in the cylinder head. A failed head gasket or porous cylinder wall is possible, but should not be
                suspected unless evidence of engine overheating or high engine mileage without proper coolant
                conditioning.
