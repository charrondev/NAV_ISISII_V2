            <para>Engine component wear patterns can often be identified and used to diagnose a problem. Some common
                examples of connecting rod wear patterns include the following:

                <item>
                    <para>A shiny surface on the edge of the piston pin bushing usually indicates that a connecting rod
                        is bent or a piston pin hole is not positioned properly in relation to the piston skirt and
                        piston ring grooves.

                <item>
                    <para>Abnormal wear on the connecting rod bearing may indicate that a connecting rod is bent or the
                        bearing bore is too tapered.

                    <para>A twisted connecting rod will not create an easily identifiable wear pattern, although
                        severely twisted connecting rods will disturb the action of the entire piston and connecting rod
                        assembly and may be the cause of excessive oil consumption.

            <para>If any of these conditions exist, use a suitable alignment fixture to check the connecting rod for
                bends and twists. Follow the instructions of the alignment fixture manufacturer. If a bend or twist
                exceeds the specification, replace the connecting rod.
