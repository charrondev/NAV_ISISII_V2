                    <para>To avoid engine damage, do not attempt to reduce journal-to-bearing running clearance by
                        reworking the bearing cap or the bearings. Grind the crankshaft to the next available under size
                        or replace crankshaft.

            <para>Bearing shells must fit tightly in the bore. When bearing shells are inserted into the connecting rod
                and cap, they protrude slightly above the parting surface. This protrusion is required to achieve
                <emph type="bold">bearing crush</emph>.
            </para>
            <para>Across the open ends, bearing shells are slightly larger than the diameter of the connecting rod bore
                into which they are assembled. This condition is designed into the bearing shell, causing it to force
                the ends inward at the parting line when a bearing crush load is applied by tightening the bolts. Some
                snap may be lost in normal use, but bearing replacement is not required because of a nominal loss of
                snap.
            </para>
            <para>When the assembly is drawn up tight, the bearing is compressed, ensuring a positive contact between
                the backside of the bearing and the machined surface of the connecting rod bore.
