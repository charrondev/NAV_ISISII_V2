                            When bearing oil clearance is checked, the crankshaft will have to be supported and held
                            against the upper main bearing halves to get a correct Plastigage&#174; reading. Use a jack
                            at the crankshaft counterweight nearest to each main bearing being checked to apply local
                            support. Failure to support the crankshaft will result in inaccurate readings.
