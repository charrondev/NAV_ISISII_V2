            <caution>
                <para>To avoid engine damage, keep the fractured mating surfaces of the connecting rod and cap clean and
                    free of lint and debris. Do not allow the mating surfaces to rest on any surface. Do not bump mating
                    surfaces or drop the connecting rod or cap. This could cause chipping and wear on the mating
                    surface, resulting in improper mating during installation and possible engine damage.

                <para>Turn the crankshaft so that the No. 1 and No. 6 connecting rod journals are at TDC. Install the
                    No. 1 and No. 6 piston and connecting rod assemblies first. Then repeat the procedure for the No. 2
                    and No. 5 assemblies. Finish with the No. 3 and No. 4 assemblies.

            <caution>
                <para>To avoid engine damage, always make sure the rod cap serial number is assembled to the same side
                    as the connecting rod serial number (they must match). If the rod cap is reversed when assembled to
                    the connecting rod or a rod cap is not installed on its original matching connecting rod, the
                    fractured mating surfaces will be ruined. This may cause the rod cap to come loose and cause severe
                    engine damage. The entire connecting rod assembly must then be replaced.

        </figure>
        <para>The fractured mating surfaces of each rod and cap pair are precisely matched. Always keep each cap with
            its respective rod. If unsure, match the serial numbers on the sides of each rod and cap.

            <caption>An offset indicates incorrect rod cap assembly</caption>
        </figure>
        <para>The rod cap can only be correctly installed on the connecting rod if it is oriented in the correct
            direction. If the rod cap is reversed during assembly of the connecting rod, an obvious offset will be seen
            at the mating surfaces. If the connecting rod assembly is installed on the crankshaft in this manner, the
            connecting rod must be replaced. Also check the crankshaft journal fillets for damage. Such damage will
            require replacement of the crankshaft.
