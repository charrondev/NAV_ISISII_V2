            <para>The ECM will control engine speed to maintain a constant road speed with cruise control. Pressing the
                set switch when the vehicle is at the desired speed with the CRUISE switch in the on position activates
                the cruise control. Speed is increased or decreased by pressing ACCEL/CRUISE switches. The cruise
                control is deactivated by pressing the off switch, applying the brake pedal, clutch pedal, or on
                vehicles equipped with automatic transmissions, by placing the transmission in neutral.

            <para>Engine speed can be controlled by the SCCS switches if the PTO option has been programmed into the ECM
                and the vehicle is stationary. Variable as well as preset speeds are available depending on ECM
                programming. The PTO function is turned on by pressing the cruise switch on. Pressing the SET/CRUISE or
                RESUME/ACCEL switches will increase or decrease engine speed depending on PTO programming.

                the ECM.

            <para>In-Cab Preset is selected by programming the ECM programmable parameters for In-Cab Mode to In-Cab
                Preset. This allows the operator to select one of two programmed values for engine speed. To operate,
                press the ON/OFF switch to the ON position. Then press either the SET/CRUISE or RESUME/ACCEL switch.
                This will cause the engine speed to run at the value programmed into PTO Set Speed.
            </para>
            <para>Pressing the off switch, brake pedal, clutch pedal, placing the automatic transmission in gear, or a
                signal from the Vehicle Speed Sensor (VSS) (unless programmed for Mobile operation), will deactivate the
                PTO speed control. PTO speed control will not be functional if the VSS signal is in fault.

                <title>In-Cab Variable</title>

            <para>In-Cab Variable is selected by programming the ECM Programmable Parameters for In-Cab Mode to In-Cab
                Variable. This option allows the operator to set the engine speed to a desired value. The control module
                will then maintain this speed over varying load conditions up to the engines rated power in the selected
                speed range.
            </para>
            <para>To enable, press the ON/OFF switch to the ON position. Speed may be adjusted two ways. First the
                operator may adjust the engine speed with the accelerator and then press the SET/CRUISE switch. Second,
                the operator may press the RESUME/ACCEL to increase engine speed incrementally or press the SET/CRUISE
                switch to decrease the engine speed.

            <para>In-Cab Mobile is selected by programming the ECM programmable parameters for the In-Cab mode to In-Cab
                Mobile. This allows the operator to use the engine speed control the same as In-Cab Variable, however,
                in this mode the vehicle can be moving while the mode is active. See In-Cab Variable for more details.
                The maximum speed of the vehicle is programmable up to 20 mph. This mode is the same as In-Cab Variable,
                however, a speed signal will not disable the speed control until the programmed maximum speed is
                exceeded.

                cruise switch circuits using the Electrical System Troubleshooting Guide. If the ESC is receiving the
                cruise switch input, use MasterDiagnostics&#174; to view the cruise switch state. If the switch state
                does not change as the switch is pressed, verify communication exists between the ECM and the ESC (does
                the ECM respond to other ESC inputs). If the switch state does change, verify that other conditions do
                not exist that would stop or delay the reaction to the input. Examples include:
