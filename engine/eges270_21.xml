        <para>The IDM has three functions:</para>
        <randlist type="bullet">
            <item>
                <para>Electronic distributor for injectors</para>
            </item>
            <item>
                <para>Power source for injectors</para>

            </item>
        </randlist>
        <para>
            <title>Electronic Distributor for Injectors</title>The IDM distributes current to the injectors. The IDM
            controls fueling to the engine by sending high voltage pulses to the OPEN and CLOSE coils of the injector.
            The IDM uses information from the ECM to determine the timing and quantity of fuel for each injector.
        </para>
        <para>The ECM uses CMP and CKP input signals to calculate engine speed and position. The ECM conditions both
            input signals and supplies the IDM with CMP and CKP output signals. The IDM uses CMP and CKP output signals
            to determine the correct sequence for injector firing.
        </para>
        <para>The ECM sends information (fuel volume, EOT, and ICP) through the CAN 2 datalink to the IDM; the IDM uses
            this information to calculate the injection cycle.
        </para>
        <para>
            <title>Injector Power Source</title>The IDM creates a constant 48 volt (DC) supply to all injectors by
            making and breaking a 12 volt source across a coil in the IDM. The 48 volts created by the collapsed field
            is stored in capacitors until used by the injectors.
        </para>
        <para>The IDM controls when the injector is turned on and how long the injector is active. The IDM first
            energizes the OPEN coil, then the CLOSE coil. The low side driver supplies a return circuit to the IDM for
            each injector coil (open and close). The high side driver controls the power supply to the injector. During
            each injection event, the low and high side drivers are switched on and off for each coil.
        </para>
        <para>
            <title>IDM and Injector Diagnostics</title>The IDM determines if an injector is drawing enough current. The
            IDM sends a fault to the ECM, indicating potential problems in the wiring harness or injector, and the ECM
            will set a DTC. The IDM also does self-diagnostic checks and sets a DTC to indicate failure of the IDM.
        </para>
        <para>On demand tests can be done using the Electronic Service Tool (EST). The EST sends a request to the ECM
            and the ECM sends a request to the IDM to do a test. Some tests generate a DTC when a problem exists. Other
            tests require the technician to evaluate parameters, if a problem exists.
