            <para>During the KOER Standard test, the ECM commands the IPR through a step test to determine if the ICP
                system is performing as expected. The ECM monitors signal values from the ICP sensor and compares those
                values to the expected values. When the Standard test is done, the ECM returns the engine to normal
                operation and transmits DTCs set during the test.
