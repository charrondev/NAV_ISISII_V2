                    <para>The Injector Disable tests can only be done with the EST; MasterDiagnostics&#174; software is

            <para>The Injector Disable tests allows the technician to shut off injectors to determine if a specific
                cylinder is contributing to engine performance. Injectors can be shut off one at a time, alternative
                cylinders at a time or alternative cylinders plus one.
            </para>
            <para>Alternate cylinders are every other cylinder in firing order.</para>
            <para>Firing order: 1-5-3-6-2-4</para>
            <para>When all cylinders are active, the contribution of each cylinder is 17% of its overall effect to
                maintain governed speed. When three cylinders are shut off, contribution of each remaining cylinder is
                33% of its overall effect to maintain governed speed. The technician should monitor fuel rate and engine
                load.
