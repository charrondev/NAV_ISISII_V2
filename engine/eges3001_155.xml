                <para>To prevent engine damage, remove carbon ridge, if evident, prior to removing the rod and piston
                    assemblies from the top of the cylinder bore. This reduces the chance of piston ring land damage
                    during removal.

                <para>This engine uses fractured connecting rods. Do not alter or damage the fractured mating surfaces
                    of the rod and cap. A cap from one connecting rod is not interchangeable with any other connecting
                    rod. The matching connecting rod and cap numbers have no significance other than indicating a
                    matched set.

        <specpara>
            <caution>
                <para>To prevent engine damage, make sure that connecting rods are installed with their caps in the
                    right direction. If a rod cap is reversed during the assembly process, an obvious offset will be
                    seen at the mating surfaces. If the connecting rod assembly is installed on the crankshaft in this
                    manner, the connecting rod must be replaced. Also, check crank pin fillets for damage as such damage
                    would require replacement of the crankshaft.
