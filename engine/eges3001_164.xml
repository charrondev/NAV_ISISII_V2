                    <para>To prevent engine damage, the rod cap can only be correctly installed on the connecting rod if
                        it is oriented in the correct direction. If the rod cap is reversed during assembly of the
                        connecting rod, an obvious offset will be seen at the mating surfaces. If the connecting rod
                        assembly is installed on the crankshaft in this manner, the connecting rod must be replaced.
                        Also check the crank pin fillets for damage. Such damage will require replacement of the
                        crankshaft.
