            <para>The fuel pump draws fuel from the fuel tank, past the fuel heater and through a 10 micron filter. A
                pressure regulator, controls fuel to the suction side of the fuel pump. The fuel heater is activated at
                10 &#176;C (50 &#176;F) and shuts off at 27 &#176;C (80 &#176;F).
            </para>
            <para>A 10 micron filter separates particles and a water separator eliminates water from the fuel drawn into
                the pump. If large amounts of water are separated, a Water In Fuel (WIF) sensor will send a signal to
                the Electronic Control Module (ECM) to illuminate the amber WATER IN FUEL lamp. Conditioned fuel is
                pumped to the secondary fuel filter assembly.
            </para>
            <para>A DTRM recirculates fuel returned from the secondary fuel filter assembly back to the unfiltered side
                of the filter or back to the fuel tank. Depending on returning fuel temperature the DTRM diverts return
                fuel flow to the fuel tanks or back through the HFCM and back to the secondary fuel filter. Above 27
                &#176;C (80 &#176;F) all fuel goes back to the fuel tank. Below 10 &#176;C (50 &#176;F) all fuel goes
                through the HFCM and back to the secondary fuel filter. Between 10 &#176;C (50 &#176;F) and 27 &#176;C
                (80 &#176;F) fuel will flow both directions through the HFCM to the secondary filter and back to the
                fuel tank.

            <para>The fuel pressure regulator is a spring loaded poppet valve. It is used to regulate and relieve
                excessive fuel pressure. Fuel that passes through the pressure regulator returns to the HFCM.
                Conditioned fuel flows through a fuel return tube to the two fuel supply ports to the cylinder heads and
                the fuel test port.
            </para>
            <para>An orifice is drilled through the side of the secondary fuel filter housing, to the return fuel
                passage on the side of the secondary fuel filter. Air that is trapped in the housing is returned through
                the return fuel passage.
            </para>
            <para>During idle and low engine loads, when injector demand is low, most of the fuel is cycled between the
                fuel filter housing and HFCM. When engine demand increases, engine fuel consumption increases; fuel
                flows through the filter with little or no cycling.
            </para>
            <para>Conditioned fuel flows through each fuel line. A check valve in a banjo bolt connect each fuel line to
                each cylinder head. The check valve prevents fuel return to the secondary fuel filter and keeps the
                drilled passages full. Fuel flows through drilled passages to the fuel injectors in each cylinder head.
                When the fuel injectors are activated, fuel flows into four inlets in each injector. Fuel does not
                return to the fuel supply system from the injectors; this is a deadhead fuel system.
