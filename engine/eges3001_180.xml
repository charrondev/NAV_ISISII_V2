                    <para>This engine utilizes hydraulic valve tappets with roller followers. Therefore, a roller
                        follower guide is needed to maintain proper roller to cam lobe orientation. Normal clearance
                        between the valve tappet and guide allows for slight tracking of roller across cam lobe. This
                        tracking of valve tappet roller is a normal characteristic as the roller accelerates and
                        decelerates during typical engine operation. Consequently, a typical wear pattern on the cam
                        lobes will exhibit tracks from side to side and have wide and narrow areas from the loading and
                        unloading of the follower. The visual wear pattern (tracking) is normal and does not require
                        camshaft replacement.
