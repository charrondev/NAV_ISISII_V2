            <para>A gerotor oil pump draws oil from the oil pan through an oil pickup tube bolted to the upper oil pan.
                Oil flows through passages in the upper oil pan, in the lower crankcase, and in the front cover to the
                gerotor oil pump. The gerotor oil pump includes the front cover assembly, gerotor assembly (inner and
                outer gears), and the gerotor housing cover. The crankshaft drives the inner rotor gear of the gerotor
                pump. Discharge oil flows through a passage in the front cover through the regulator valve to the
                gerotor pump suction.
