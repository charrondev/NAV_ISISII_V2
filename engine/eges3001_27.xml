            <para>A thermistor sensor changes its electrical resistance with changes in temperature. Resistance in the
                thermistor decreases as temperature increases, and increases as temperature decreases. Thermistors work
                with a resistor that limits current in the ECM to form a voltage signal matched with a temperature
                value.
