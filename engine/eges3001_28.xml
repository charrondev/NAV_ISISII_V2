            <caption>Glow plug control system</caption>
        </figure>
        <para>The glow plug control system warms the engine cylinders to aid cold engine starting and reduce exhaust
            emissions during warm-up.
        </para>
        <para>The ECM energizes the glow plugs, by energizing glow plug relay while monitoring programmed conditions for
            engine coolant temperature and atmospheric pressure.
        </para>
        <para>The ECM monitors battery voltage and uses information from the BAP sensor and ECT sensor to determine the
            time that the WAIT TO START lamp is ON and the activation of the glow plug relay. The ECM controls the WAIT
            TO START lamp and the glow plug relay separately. The glow plugs are self-limiting and do not require
            cycling on and off. The glow plug relay will cycle on and off repeatedly if system voltage is greater than
            14.0 volts.
        </para>
        <para>The engine is ready to start when the WAIT TO START lamp is turned off by the ECM. The glow plugs can
            remain on up to 120 seconds while the engine is running to reduce exhaust emissions during engine warm-up.
        </para>
        <para>Glow plug activation time is increased, if the engine is cold and the barometric pressure is low (high
            altitude).
        </para>
