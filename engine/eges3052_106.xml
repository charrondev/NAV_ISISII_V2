            <para>The Injector Disable tests allows the technician to shut off injectors to determine if a specific
                cylinder is contributing to engine performance. Injectors can be shut off one at a time.

            <para>When all cylinders are active, the contribution of each cylinder is 17% of its overall effect to
                maintain governed speed. The technician should monitor fuel rate and engine load.
