                <title>Function</title>The APS/IVS sensor is a cab mounted potentiometer sensor. When the APS receives a
                5 volt reference signal and a ground from the ECM, a linear analog voltage signal from the sensor will
                indicate the operator's demand for power. The IVS provides 0 or 12 volts to the ECM as redundant signal
                to verify the pedal idle position.

                <title>APS</title>The ECM supplies a regulated 5 volt signal from ECM chassis connector Pin X4-4 to APS
                connector Pin C. The APS returns a variable voltage signal (depending on pedal position) from the APS
                connector Pin A to ECM Pin X4-18. The APS is grounded at Pin B from the ECM Pin X4-24.

            <para>
                <title>APS Auto-Calibration</title>The ECM learns the lowest and highest pedal positions by reading and
                storing the minimum and maximum voltage levels from the APS. In this manner the ECM auto-calibrates the
                system to allow maximum pedal sensitivity. The ECM auto-calibrates as ignition switch is on, but when
                ignition switch is turned OFF, these values are lost. When ignition switch is turned on again, this
                process starts over. When the pedal is disconnected (or a new one is installed), the pedal does not need
                to be calibrated. It simply auto-calibrates the new pedal assembly whenever ignition switch is turned on
                again.

                <title>IVS</title>The ECM expects to receive one of two signals through the ECM chassis connector Pin
                X4-12 from APS/IVS connector Pin D:

            <para>The IVS receives a 12 volt ignition voltage at Pin F from the ignition fuse in the power distribution
                box. When the pedal is not in the idle position (throttle applied), the IVS supplies a 12 volt signal to
                the ECM.
            </para>
            <para>The ECM compares APS/IVS inputs to verify when the pedal is in the idle position. If the APS signal at
                Pin X4-18 indicates throttle is being applied, the ECM expects to see 12 volts at the IVS. If the APS
                signal indicates throttle is not applied, the ECM expects to see 0 volts at the IVS. The timing process
                is critical between the APS and IVS sensors. For this reason, it is very difficult to determine if the
                APS/IVS assembly is working correctly when using a DMM.
            </para>
            <para>
                <title>Fault Detection/Management</title>When ignition switch is on, the ECM continuously monitors the
                APS/IVS circuits for expected voltages. It also compares the APS and IVS signals for conflict. If the
                signals are not what the ECM expects to see, DTCs will be set.
            </para>
            <para>Any detected malfunction of the APS/IVS sensor circuit will illuminate the amber WEL. If the ECM
                detects an APS signal Out of Range HIGH or LOW, the engine will ignore the APS signal and operate at low
                idle. If a disagreement in the state of IVS and APS is detected by the ECM and the ECM determines that
                it is an IVS fault, the ECM will only allow a maximum of 50% APS to be commanded. If the ECM cannot
                discern if it is an APS or IVS fault, the engine will be allowed to operate at low idle only.
