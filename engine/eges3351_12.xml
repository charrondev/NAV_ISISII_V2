            <title>High-Pressure Oil Flow</title>
            <para>The lubrication system constantly refills the oil reservoir located in the front cover. The reservoir
                provides oil for the high-pressure oil pump. The pump is mounted on the backside of the front cover and
                gear driven from the front of the engine.
            </para>
            <para>High-pressure oil is directed to the high-pressure oil hose, cylinder head passage, and high-pressure
                oil manifold, which is located beneath the valve cover.
            </para>
            <para>High-pressure oil is used by the fuel injectors to inject, pressurize, and atomize fuel in the
                cylinders. This occurs when the OPEN coil for each fuel injector is energized.
            </para>
            <para>Excess high-pressure oil is directed to the crankcase sump by the Injection Pressure Regulator (IPR)
                valve. The IPR valve is controlled by the Engine Control Module (ECM) to maintain a desired injection
                control pressure.
            </para>
            <para>If equipped with the optional engine brake, some high-pressure oil is directed internally to the

            </figure>
            <para>The ICP system is a closed loop system that uses the ICP sensor to continuously provide injection
                control pressure feedback to the ECM. The ECM commands the IPR duty cycle to adjust ICP pressure to
                match engine requirements.

            </figure>
            <para>The IPR solenoid receives a pulse-width modulated signal from the ECM. This indicates the on and off
                time the IPR control valve is energized. The pulse is calibrated to control ICP pressure which ranges
                from 5 MPa (725 psi) up to 32 MPa (4,650 psi).
            </para>
            <para>The IPR valve is mounted in the body of the high-pressure pump. The IPR valve maintains desired
                injection control pressure by dumping excess oil back to the crankcase sump.
            </para>
            <para>As demand for injection control pressure increases, the ECM increases the pulse-width modulation to
                the IPR solenoid. When demand for injection control pressure decreases, the duty cycle to the IPR
                solenoid decreases and more oil is allowed to flow to the drain orifice.
            </para>
            <para>When the injection control pressure electrical signal is out-of-range, the ECM sets a Diagnostic
                Trouble Code (DTC). The ECM will not set DTCs if an injection control pressure signal corresponds to an
                in-range valve for injection control pressure for a given operating condition.
            </para>
            <para>When ICP signals that are out-of-range, the ECM ignores out-of-range signals and go into open loop
                operation. The IPR valve will operate from programmed default values.

            <para>Two 48 volt, 20 amp coils control a spool valve that directs oil flow in and out of the injector. The
                injector coils are turned on for approximately 800 &#181;s (microseconds). Each injector has a single
                four pin connector that couples to the valve cover gasket assembly.

            <para>When the spool valve is open, high-pressure oil enters the injector pushing down the intensifier
                piston and plunger. Since the intensifier piston is 7.1 times greater in surface area than the plunger,
                the injection pressure is also 7.1 times greater than injection control pressure on the plunger.

            <para>Fuel pressure builds at the base of the plunger in the barrel. When the intensifier piston pushes the
                plunger down, the plunger increases fuel pressure in the barrel 7.1 times greater than injection control
                pressure. The plunger has a hardened coating to resist scuffing.
