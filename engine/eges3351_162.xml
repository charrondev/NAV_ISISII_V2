        <para>The high-pressure oil system draws oil from the front cover reservoir into the high-pressure oil pump. The
            high-pressure oil pump pressurizes this oil which is forced through the high-pressure hose, high-pressure
            oil manifold, and sent to the oil inlet on top of each fuel injector. High-pressure oil increases fuel
            pressure inside the injectors, which deliver high-pressure fuel to each cylinder.
