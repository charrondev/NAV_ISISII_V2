                <para>To prevent engine damage, do not allow connecting rod or connecting rod cap fractured mating
                    surfaces to contact any surface other then its matched fractured surface. Contacting any other
                    surface could cause misalignment of the mating surface, resulting in connecting rod bearing and
                    engine failure.
