                    <para>Connecting rod bearings must fit tightly in the connecting rod bore. When bearings are
                        inserted in the connecting rod and cap, they protrude slightly above the parting surface. This
                        protrusion is required to achieve bearing crush. Bearing crush forces the ends inward at the
                        parting line when a load is applied by tightening the bolts. Some snap may be lost in normal
                        use, but bearing replacement is not required because of a nominal loss of snap.
                    </para>
                    <para>When the connecting rod bearing is installed and the connecting rod cap bolts are tightened,
                        the bearing is compressed, ensuring a positive contact between the backside of the bearing and
                        the machined surface of the connecting rod bore.
