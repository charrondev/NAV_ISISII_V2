                of the flywheel housing and driven through idler gears by the crankshaft.

                <revst/>
                <title>High-pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP) assembly</title>The HPFP is a three piston volumetric pump that
                supplies fuel at high pressure to both the fuel rails. The HPFP is mounted in the rear valley on top of
                the engine and driven by the camshaft.

                shaft as the HPFP assembly. The ITP supplies fuel at a slightly higher pressure and flow to the Fuel
                Volume Control Valve (FVCV). Cooling flow for the ITP is provided by routing fuel back to the suction
                side of the transfer pump. The discharge of the ITP has an orifice and check valve that also provides
                additional cooling for the ITP by routing flow to the fuel cooler.

            <para>
                <title>Fuel Volume Control Valve (FVCV)</title>The FVCV regulates the volume of flow sent to the HPFP.
                The FVCV is located in the HPFP assembly and controlled by the FRP via the ECM. The FVCV puts the
                necessary quantity of fuel under pressure to the HPFP.
            </para>
            <para>FVCV control depends on engine speed, injector quantity, fuel temperature, and the number of

            <para>
                <title>Fuel Pressure Control Valve (FPCV)</title>The FPCV controls the fuel pressure to the fuel rails.
                The FPCV is located in the HPFP assembly and is controlled by the FRP via the ECM. FPCV control depends
                on fuel pressure and fuel temperature.
            </para>
            <para>
                <title>Fuel Rail Pressure (FRP) sensor</title>The FRP monitors the fuel pressure in the fuel rails and
                sends a signal to the ECM. It is located in the right fuel rail. The FRP sensor harness is routed
                through the right Under Valve Cover (UVC) harness along with the fuel injector connections.

            <title>High-pressure Piezo Common Rail (HPCR) System</title>
            <para>The HPFP pumps fuel through separate tubes to each fuel rail. Each fuel rail has four fuel tubes, one
                for each injector, that maintain constant pressure from the high-pressure pump to each injector.
            </para>
            <para>The injectors operate in five cycles; two pre-injection cycles, a main-injection cycle, a
                post-injection cycle, and a late post-injection cycle. The pre-injection cycles and post-injection cycle
                reduce combustion noise, mechanical load, and exhaust emissions. The main-injection cycle injects and
                atomizes fuel in the combustion chambers for combustion. The late post-injection cycle adds fuel to the
                exhaust to regenerate the aftertreatment system.
            </para>
            <para>Each injector has an actuator that opens or closes the injector nozzle. Charging the actuator opens
                the nozzle. The nozzle is closed by discharging the actuator. The ECM charges and discharges each
                actuator by energizing the appropriate high side or low side output. The low side output supplies a
                return circuit for each actuator.
