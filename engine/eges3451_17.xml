            <para>The lubrication system is pressure regulated, full flow cooled, and full flow filtered.</para>
            <para>A gerotor oil pump draws oil from the oil pan through an oil pickup tube. Oil then flows through
                passages in the lower crankcase, front cover, and in the oil pump housing to the gerotor oil pump.
            </para>
            <para>The gerotor oil pump includes the oil pump housing and cover, gerotor assembly (inner and outer
                gears), and the pressure regulating valve assembly. The crankshaft drives the inner rotor gear of the
                gerotor pump.
            </para>
            <para>Oil pressure is maintained by the pressure regulating valve assembly. The pressure regulating valve in
                the discharge oil flow relieves excess oil pressure back to the suction side of the gerotor oil pump.

            <para>Pressurized oil from the pump flows through passages in the oil pump housing and upper crankcase to
                the oil cooler cover. Oil flows through plates in the cooler, is cooled, and then flows back to the oil
                cooler cover.
            </para>
            <para>If the oil cooler is restricted, a bypass valve in the oil filter base opens, oil bypasses the oil
                cooler, and flows to the oil filter base.
            </para>
            <para>Oil flows through the oil filter base to the oil filter element. If the oil filter element is
                restricted, a bypass valve in the oil filter return line opens. Oil bypasses the oil filter element and
                flows to the oil filter base. Both bypass valves ensure full flow of oil to the engine if the filter or
                cooler is restricted. The oil filter base directs filtered oil to the oil supply tube to lubricate the
                turbocharger, EOP sensor, EOT sensor, diagnostic port, and oil cooler cover. Lubricating oil from the
                turbocharger drains back to the oil pan. When the oil filter is removed, oil flows through a drain valve
                in the oil filter base back to the oil pan.
