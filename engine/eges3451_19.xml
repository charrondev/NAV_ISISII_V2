            <title>Water Pump</title>
            <para>The centrifugal water pump is mounted in the front crankcase cover. The water pump has a built in
                reservoir to catch small amounts of coolant that may seep past the seal. Water pump rotation is
                counter-clockwise when viewed from the front of the engine.

                thermostats.

                Flow is directed through passages in the crankcase and ports in the front cover to support cooling
                system requirements.

                <title>Thermostats</title>Two thermostats are located in the thermostat housing. If the coolant
                temperature is above the thermostat opening temperature, coolant flows to the radiator to be cooled. If
                the coolant temperature is below the opening temperature for both thermostats, both thermostats are
                closed. Coolant returns back to the water pump through a bypass on one of the thermostats. As the
                coolant temperature increases, the first thermostat starts to open and flow starts through the radiator.
                As coolant temperature continues to increase, the first thermostat will fully open. The second
                thermostat will then start to open, increasing flow to the radiator until both thermostats are fully
                open.
            </para>
            <para>
                <title>Deaeration Tank</title>The radiator and the coolant system are kept full and pressurized by the
                deaeration tank. As coolant in the radiator heats up and expands, the level in the deaeration tank goes
                up and pressure increases. The deaeration tank also removes air from the cooling system.

                <title>Radiator Shutters</title>Closing the radiator shutters will keep the engine warm during cold
                weather operation. This provides faster warm up of the passenger cab and faster windshield defrosting.
            </para>
            <para>
                <title>Fuel Coolant Valve (FCV)</title>The FCV is used to redirect coolant through the fuel cooler. The
                ECM uses the Engine Fuel Temperature (EFT) sensor to monitor fuel temperature and controls the FCV to
                maintain the desired fuel temperature. The valve opens automatically allowing coolant to pass through
                the cooler. The ECM controls this valve in cold weather to warm the fuel and also prevents the
                temperature from getting too hot.
