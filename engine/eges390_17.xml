        <para>The HFCM fuel pump draws fuel from the fuel tank, across an electric fuel heater and through a 10 micron
            fuel filter. The electric fuel heater is activated when the incoming fuel temperature is below 10 &#176;C
            (50 &#176;F) and is deactivated when incoming fuel temperature reaches 27 &#176;C (80 &#176;F). A 10 micron
            fuel filter/water separator separates particles and water from the incoming fuel before reaching the pump.
            The conditioned fuel is then pumped to the secondary fuel filter assembly. The outlet fuel pressure is
            controlled by a pressure relief valve located within the fuel pump. When the water separated from the
            incoming fuel accumulates in the water sump a Water In Fuel (WIF) sensor sends a signal to the Electronic
            Control Module (ECM) and illuminates the amber WATER IN FUEL lamp.
        </para>
        <para>During cold temperature operation, the Diesel Thermo Recirculation Module (DTRM), located in the HFCM,
            redirects the warm fuel returned from the secondary fuel filter assembly back into the unfiltered side of
            the HFCM filter. When the incoming fuel temperature is below 30 &#176;C (85&#176; F), a portion of the
            return fuel will be redirected into the HFCM to increase the supply fuel temperature. When the incoming fuel
            temperature reaches 38 &#176;C (100 &#176;F) the DTRM will divert all the return fuel back to the tank.
