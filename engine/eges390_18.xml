        <para>Conditioned fuel flows through a fuel return tube to the two fuel supply ports to the cylinder heads and
            the fuel test port.
        </para>
        <para>An orifice is drilled through the side of the secondary fuel filter housing, to the return fuel passage on
            the side of the secondary fuel filter. Air trapped in the housing is returned through the return fuel
            passage.
        </para>
        <para>During idle and low engine loads most of the fuel is cycled between the fuel filter housing and HFCM. When
            engine load increases, engine fuel consumption increases; fuel flows through the filter with little or no
            cycling.
        </para>
        <para>A banjo bolt, with check valve, connects each fuel line to each cylinder head. The check valve prevents
            fuel return to the secondary fuel filter and keeps the drilled passages full. Fuel flows through drilled
            passages to the fuel injectors in each cylinder head. When the fuel injectors are activated, fuel flows into
            three inlets in each injector. Fuel does not return to the fuel supply system from the injectors; this is a
            deadhead fuel system.
        </para>
        <para>A four micron filter element in the fuel filter separates particles in the fuel.</para>

        <para>The fuel pressure regulator is a spring loaded poppet valve used to regulate and relieve excessive fuel
            pressure. Fuel passing through the pressure regulator returns to the HFCM.
