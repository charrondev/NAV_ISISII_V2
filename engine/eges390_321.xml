            <note>
                <para>Bearing shells must fit tightly in the bore. When bearing shells are inserted into the connecting
                    rod and cap, they protrude above the parting line. This protrusion is required to achieve "bearing
                    crush." Therefore connecting rod caps must be wiped clean prior to installation of the bearing
                    shell.
                </para>
                <para>Bearing shells across the open ends are slightly larger than the diameter of the connecting rod
                    bore into which they are assembled. This condition is designed into the bearing shell, causing it to
                    spread outward at the parting line when "bearing crush" load is applied by tightening the bolts.
                    Some snap may be lost in normal use, but bearing replacement is not required because of a nominal
                    loss of snap.

        <para>When the assembly is drawn up tight, the bearing is compressed, ensuring a positive contact between the
            backside of the bearing and the bore.

                <para>To prevent engine damage, make sure connecting rods are installed with their caps in the right
                    direction. If a rod cap is reversed during assembly, an obvious offset will be seen at the mating
                    surfaces. If the connecting rod assembly is installed on the crankshaft this way, the connecting rod
                    must be replaced. Also, check crank pin fillets for damage as such damage would require replacement
                    of the crankshaft.
