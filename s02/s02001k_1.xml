                    <para>Front wheel alignment is part of
                        <emph type="bold">Total Vehicle Alignment</emph>
                        which involves both steering and drive axles. Correct front wheel alignment is important. It
                        promotes longer tire wear by reducing lateral forces on tires, better known as side scrub.
                        Reduced side scrub promotes slow tire wear and a greater tread mileage potential. It promotes
                        ease of handling and reduces strain on the steering and axle components.
                    </para>
                    <para>It is important to recognize the symptoms of proper alignment as well as those of improper
                        alignment. It is also important to be able to recognize treadwear tendencies not related to
                        alignment.
                    </para>
                    <para>Proper alignment will improve miles per 32nd of tread wear, resulting in higher mileage at the
                        removal stage.
                    </para>
                    <para>Inspect tires at regular intervals. Unbalanced tread wear patterns may indicate worn front
                        axle and/or steering parts, out-of-balance tires, or an out-of-alignment condition.
                    </para>

                                fast.

                                - A small wear differential between the left front and right front tire also indicates
                                good alignment. A 15 to 20 percent faster rate on the left front tire is acceptable.

                                condition does not always signal misalignment. Compare tire mileage to the fleet

                        <title>P &#38; D Service</title>In P &#38; D service where a vehicle makes many turns per mile,
                        the left front tire may wear faster than the right front tire. To balance this condition, it is
                        recommended that steer tires be swapped side to side when "half" worn. P &#38; D service may
                        also create what appears as camber wear due to many turns. Bending the axle will not correct
                        this condition.

                        <title>Line Haul Service</title>Left front tires in line haul service generally wear slightly
                        faster than right front tires, primarily because of steering gear box locations and the high
                        frequency of steering inputs to the left side. Also, left front tires wear more uniformly than
                        right front tires because the slower-wearing right tires tend to show more irregularity.

                                Proper diagnosis becomes more difficult during late wear stages because "wear
                                progression" generally does not occur in a uniform fashion.

                        drag link ends, steering gear, shock absorbers and tire inflation should be inspected and
                        corrected where necessary.

                            steering components. Thorough visual inspection for indications of wear or stress and the
                            replacement of such parts as are necessary will eliminate costly and avoidable front end
