        <para>Ackerman angle is measured in degrees and is the amount one front wheel turns sharper than the other on a
            turn.

        <para>If the inner wheel is not permitted to turn in a smaller circle or at a greater angle, tire scuffing will
            result. Therefore, it is necessary for the front wheels to assume a toed-out position during a turn.
        </para>
        <para>Toe-out on turns is accomplished by having the ends of lower steering arms (tie rod arms) closer together
            than the king pins as shown in
            <hotlnk xrefid="f0200121">Figure 21</hotlnk>
            . The amount of toe-out depends on the length and angle of the steering arms. Toe-out in turns varies with
            the wheelbase. Typically there is more toe-out in turns with shorter wheelbase vehicles and less with longer
            wheelbase vehicles.

        <para>Even though the toe-in with the wheels in the straight-ahead position may be adjusted correctly, a bent
            steering arm may cause the toe-out on a turn to be incorrect, causing scuffing of tires.

        <para>The Ackerman angle is checked using turning radius plates.</para>
        <para>To check the Ackerman angle, position the front wheels on the plates and in the straight-ahead position.
            After removing the locking pins from each plate, adjust the scale on the edge of the plates so that the
            pointers read "zero." Turn the wheels to the right until the gauge at the right wheel reads 20&#176;. Then
            read the angle of the left wheel. Turn the wheels to the left until the gauge at the left wheel reads 20&#176;.
            Then read the angle on the right gauge. The right wheel should be at the same angle as the left wheel was
            when the wheels were turned to the right.
