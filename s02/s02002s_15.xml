                assembly. Then as the exciter ring cools, it shrinks on the mating surface of the wheel hub.The signal
                is transmitted from the sensor to the ABS electronic control unit.

                push the sensor in against the exciter ring.

                    placing it in a 200-degree-Fahrenheit (approximate) bath (water or oil) until the desired
                    temperature is achieved. Then install the exciter ring onto the wheel hub, taking care to fully seat
                    the exciter ring, then allow the exciter ring to cool and "shrink fit" on the wheel hub.
