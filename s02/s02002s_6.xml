        <svcsubsecinfo>
            <para>Satisfactory wheel seal operation as well as long bearing life depends on correct wheel bearing
                installation, cleanliness, lubrication and adjustment. The following will help you perform these
                required services for front wheels and hubs.
            </para>
            <para>Wheels or hubs, bearing cups, locking nuts, washers, hub caps, and spindles are to be clean from any
                foreign matter. Bearings must be pre-lubed before installation. Refer to GROUP 10 - LUBRICATION in the
                CTS-5000 Master Service Manual for the proper lube specifications.

                    <para>If new bearing(s) are being installed, the new bearings must be seated to insure maximum
                        service reliability. After the bearing and hub are assembled on the spindle, install the bearing
                        adjustment nut. Tighten the adjustment nut to 120 to 140 ft-lbs. (163 to 190 Nm) while rotating
                        the hub to seat the bearing. Back off the adjusting nut 1/2 turn and follow the procedure below.

                installed.

            <para>Mount the dial indicator at the bottom of the wheel (remove hub cap or axle shaft if installed), or on

                . Grasp drum, hub or tire at 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock position. First push, then pull evenly on the drum
                hub or tire to measure the amount of end play. Note total indicator reading.

            <para>The bearing adjustment procedures are intended to result in .001 to .010 inch (.0254 to .254 mm) end
                play with no preload. However, for longer seal life, the .001 to .005 inch (.0254 to .1270 mm) end play
                (clearance) should be strived for (measured after the jam nut is torqued).
