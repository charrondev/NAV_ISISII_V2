        <para>Universal joint adjustment is made at the factory and is controlled by means of shims placed between the
            drive flange and the outer surface of the hub. Adjustment should only be required if three or more of the
            following components have been replaced since the unit was manufactured: Drive flange, outer axle shaft,
            spindle, spindle yoke, or hub.
