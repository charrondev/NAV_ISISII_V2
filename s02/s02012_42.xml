        <title>Adjust Toe</title>
        <para>Toe is the relationship of the distance between the front of the front tires and the rear of the front
            tires.
        </para>
        <para>When the front distance is less than the rear distance, the wheels are 'toed in.' Toe-in is designed into
            the vehicle to counteract the tendency of the tires to toe-out when the vehicle is driven.
        </para>
        <para>Incorrect toe setting will result in rapid tire wear. The toe setting for an all-wheel drive vehicle
            depends on the vocation. Frequent front drive axle use requires a nominal toe-out setting, while infrequent
            front drive axle use requires a nominal toe-in setting. Contact the vehicle manufacturer for the correct toe
            setting.

                <para>Most tire wear is caused by incorrect toe settings. Do not change camber or caster settings to
                    correct tire wear problems. If the axle assembly is bent to change caster or camber, the strength of
                    the axle is reduced and the warranty is voided. An axle damaged by bending may cause a vehicle
