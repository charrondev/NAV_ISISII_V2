        <para>Often a valve is unnecessarily replaced. There are basic steps to be performed to determine if the valve
            is defective or if proper adjustment has not been performed. To determine the status of a valve, perform the
            following service checks:
        </para>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">Remove cotter pin and washer from upper link. Loosen the clamp and detach the vertical
                linkage from the height control lever arm.
            </para>

            <para count="1">Assure that brake air reservoir pressure is at governor cut-off pressure or about 100 psi
                (689.5 kPa).

        <step1>
            <para count="1">Raise height control valve lever approximately 45 degrees above horizontal. Air pressure at
                the air springs should begin to increase within 15 seconds which will cause the truck frame to rise.
                This can easily be detected by feeling the shock absorber extend at the dust tube to shock absorber body
                joint.

            <para count="1">Lower height control valve lever approximately 45 degrees below horizontal. Air pressure at
                the air springs should begin to decrease. Let air escape until air spring height is approximately 10
