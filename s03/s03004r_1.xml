                    <para>Constant rate springs (
                        <hotlnk xrefid="f0300401">Figure 1</hotlnk>) are leaf-type springs that have a constant rate of
                        deflection.

                            <para>Example of Constant Rate of Deflection - If 500 pounds will deflect the spring leaves
                                1 inch (25.4 mm), 1,000 pounds will deflect the same spring leaves 2 inches (50.8 mm).
                                This shows that the rate of deflection is constant.

                        usually mounted on top of the rear spring assemblies. The auxiliary springs take part of a load
                        by contacting special brackets on the frame rail slides when the load is heavy enough to
                        compress the rear springs to the point of contact.

                        rate is obtained from the varying effective lengths of the springs, which is accomplished by use
                        of cam-type brackets. As the spring assembly deflects, the points contacted on the brackets are
                        closer to the center of the spring assembly, shortening the effective length (
                        <hotlnk xrefid="f0300402">Figure 2</hotlnk>and
