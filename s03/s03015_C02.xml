            <para>Caster is the amount in degrees the top of the kingpin is tilted toward the front or rear of the
                truck, as viewed from the side of the truck. The caster angle can range from a positive angle to a
                negative angle and this angle is measured in degrees.

            <para>Proper caster is important for directional stability and return-ability. Too much positive caster can
                cause shimmy, excessive steering effort, and is normally a vehicle performance and handling
                consideration. Uneven positive caster may create a steering pull toward the side with the lower caster.
                This attribute may be used to compensate for crowned roads. The correct amount of caster helps to keep
                the front wheels in the straight-ahead position. When in a turn, caster acts as a lever, assisting the
                driver to return the front wheels to the straight-ahead position.
            </para>
            <para>Caster specifications are based on vehicle design load, which will usually result in a level frame. If
                the frame is not level when alignment checks are made, this must be considered in determining whether
                the caster setting is correct.

            <para>With the vehicle on a smooth, level surface, frame angle should be measured with a bubble protractor
                placed on the frame rail. The degree of tilt from the level frame position is the angle that must be
                used in determining a correct caster setting. Positive frame angle is defined as forward tilt (front end
                down) and negative angle as tilt to rear (front end height).
