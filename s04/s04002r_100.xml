            <title>Description</title>
            <para>The Bendix TP-5 is a panel or crossmember mounted tractor protection valve. It has two additional
                double check valve and quick release functions. It contains a service line shut-off valve with exhaust
                function, a service line QRV (quick release valve) and two double check valves.

            <title>Operation</title>
            <para>The function of the TP-5 is to receive all pneumatic signals pertinent to the operation of the trailer
                braking system, transmit same to the trailer and also to protect the tractor air supply in case of
                separation of the connecting lines to the trailer (

            <para>Air from the tractor protection control valve in the cab enters at the tractor protection delivery
                port (Item 8) and passes out the trailer supply port (Item 7) and simultaneously acts upon the service
                line shut off plunger (Item 9) moving the service line inlet valve off its seat and opening the service
                line passage. With common air to the supply side and service side of the manifold, the valve should open
                at approximately 45 psi. If the Tractor Protection Control Valve is manually or automatically moved to
                the exhaust position, the service line shut-off valve will close at approximately 10 psi and the exhaust
                passage in the plunger will vent the trailer service line (Item 5).

            <para>
                <title>Double Check Valves</title>
            </para>
            <para>The two double check valves in the TP-5 serve to pick up the highest pressure service signal from
                either the tractor front brake circuit (secondary) (Item 10), rear brake circuit (primary) (Item 1) or
                trailer control valve signal (Item 3), operating the trailer brakes accordingly. The stop light switch
                port also picks up this signal and actuates the stop light switch (Item 2).

                <hotlnk xrefid="f0400249">Figure 49</hotlnk>
                This cover also houses a quick release valve. The diaphragm seals off the exhaust port on application
                and upon release of service line application, permits the trailer service line air to exhaust through
                the exhaust port, thus permitting faster release times for trailer brake release.
