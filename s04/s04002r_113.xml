            <para>The hand control valve is used for controlling the brakes on a trailer independently of the brakes on
                the towing vehicle. The valve is usually mounted on the steering column or on the dash and provides the
                operator with a graduated means of applying and releasing the brakes. The distance the brake handle is
                moved in a clockwise direction toward applied position determines the severity of the brake application.

                    <para>Do not use the hand control valve to hold the brakes applied when the chassis is parked and
                        unattended. Air may leak from system and vehicle will move.

            <title>Apply</title>
            <para>When the handle (Item 6) is moved in a clockwise direction from the released position, a rotary force
                is applied to a spiral cam (Item 22) which in turn converts rotary motion to axial thrust that forces
                the compensator spring (Item 21) into compression. The spring (Item 21) acting on the piston (Item 20),
                moves the piston along the centerline of the valve to close the gap between itself and the discharge
                valve assembly (Item 19) which closes off air passage between cavities (A) and (B). Further piston
                movement opens the inlet valve (Item 16) by moving it away from the valve seat of body (Item 17).
            </para>
            <para>Reservoir air pressure at the supply inlet port enters cavity (A) and passes through to the delivery
                port (E) and out to the trailer service brake line. The delivery port (E) is common to cavity (A). Air
                is blocked from exhausting through (B).
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Hold</title>
            <para>Air pressure in cavity (A) acts against the piston (Item 20) to move it axially against the spring
                (Item 21). When the resultant forces above and below the piston (Item 20) approach a balance, it moves
                to allow the inlet valve to seat against the body (Item 17). Providing that spring forces and air
                pressure forces maintain equilibrium by virtue of holding the cam position and air pressures at the
                resultant condition, the valve attains a "lap" position. It is instantly responsive to any change in
                lever movement to increase or decrease the delivery pressure. This controlled modulating characteristic
                occurs from 0 to about 80 psi. When the handle is traveled fully clockwise, the valve will deliver full
                inlet supply pressure.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Release</title>
            <para>Returning the handle (Item 6) towards the "off" position reduces the forces of the spring (Item 21)
                acting against the piston (Item 10). The "lap" position whereby both exhaust valve and inlet valve are
                seated simultaneously is instantaneously traversed. Force from air pressure in main cavity (A) continues
                to move piston (Item 20) away from discharge valve (Item 19). Air pressure feeding back from the
                delivery port (E) enters cavity (B) and exhausts to the atmosphere through the exhaust port (D).
