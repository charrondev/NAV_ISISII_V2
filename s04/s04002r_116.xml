            <para>The CR Brakemaster (
                <hotlnk xrefid="f0400260">Figure 60</hotlnk>
                ) functions as a heat exchanger, cooling air from the compressor.

            <para>When the compressed air leaves the air compressor, it is approximately 300&#176;F (149&#176;C), and by
                the time it reaches the Brakemaster unit, it has cooled to 140&#176;F (60&#176;C).
            </para>
            <para>The hot, compressed air enters the expansion chamber where the sudden drop in pressure provides
                additional cooling. Heat is dissipated through the external fins on the one-piece aluminum body.
            </para>
            <para>As the air cools in the expansion chamber, both water and oil vapors are condensed. This condensation
                collects on the walls of the expansion chamber and runs down into the collection area where it is
                automatically discharged through an unloader valve.
            </para>
            <para>The heat exchanger has a permanent air filter element which traps carbon particles harmful to other
                components in the air system. Each time the unloader operates (each time the compressor completes a
                cycle), there is a back-rush of air through the filter, so that any carbon trapped in the filter element
                is flushed out and ejected through the unloader valve.
            </para>
            <para>If the air compressor is working properly, the filter will require little or no maintenance. If the
                filter should require servicing, flush it with cleaning solvent and air dry.
