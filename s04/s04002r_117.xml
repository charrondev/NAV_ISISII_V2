            <para>The function of the AD-9 Air Dryer (
                <hotlnk xrefid="f0400264">Figure 64</hotlnk>
                ) is to collect and remove air system contaminants in solid, liquid and vapor form before they enter the
                brake system. It provides clean, dry air to the components of the brake system, which increases the life
                of the system and reduces maintenance costs.

            <para>The AD-9 Air Dryer consists of the desiccant cartridge and a die cast aluminum end cover secured to a
                cylindrical steel outer shell with eight capscrews and nuts. The end cover contains a check valve
                assembly, a safety valve, three threaded air connections and the purge valve housing assembly. The
                removable purge valve housing assembly incorporates a purge valve mechanism and a turbocharger cutoff
                feature that is designed to prevent loss of engine "turbo" boost pressure during the purge cycle of the
                air dryer. The desiccant cartridge and discharger check valve assembly are screw-in type. The purge
                valve housing assembly, which includes the heater and thermostat assembly, and the discharge check valve
                assembly, are serviceable from the exterior of the air dryer. The screw-in desiccant cartridge requires
                removal of the air dryer assembly from the vehicle.

            <para>When the compressor is loaded (compressing air), compressed air, along with oil, oil vapor, water and
                water vapor flows through the compressor discharge line to the supply port (Item 10) of the air dryer
                end cover. As air travels through the end cover assembly, its direction of flow changes several times,
                reducing the temperature, causing contaminants to condense and drop to the bottom or sump of the air
                dryer end cover.
            </para>
            <para>After exiting the end cover, the air flows into the desiccant cartridge (Item 17). Once in the
                desiccant cartridge, air first flows through an oil separator (Item 15), which removes water in liquid
                form as well as oil, oil vapor and solid contaminants.
            </para>
            <para>Air exits the oil separator and enters the desiccant drying bed (Item 16). Air flowing through the
                column of desiccant becomes progressively dryer as water vapor adheres to the desiccant material in a
                process known as ADSORPTION. The desiccant cartridge using the adsorption process removes water vapor
                from the pressurized air.
            </para>
            <para>Dry air flows out of the purge volume through the single check valve assembly (Item 4) and out the
                delivery port (Item 5) to the first (supply) reservoir (Item 11) of the air system.

            <para>When air brake system pressure reaches the cutout setting of the governor (Item 13), the compressor
                unloads (air compression stopped) and the purge cycle of the air dryer begins. When the governor unloads
                the compressor, it pressurizes the compressor unloader mechanism line connecting the governor unloader
                port to the dryer end cover control port (Item 14). The purge piston (Item 18) moves in response to air
                pressure, causing the purge valve (Item 9) to open to atmosphere and (partially) closing off the supply
                of air from the compressor. Contaminants in the end cover sump (Item 6) are expelled immediately when
                the purge valve (Item 9) opens. Also, air which was flowing through the desiccant cartridge (Item 17)
                changes direction and begins to flow toward the open purge valve (Item 9). Oil and solid contaminants
                collected by the oil separator (Item 15) are removed by air flowing from the desiccant drying bed (Item
                16) to the open purge valve (Item 9).
            </para>
            <para>The initial purge and desiccant cartridge decompression lasts only a few seconds and is evidenced by
                an audible burst of air at the exhaust (Item 8). The reactivation of the desiccant drying bed begins as
                dry air flows from purge volume (Item 3) through the desiccant cartridge purge orifice (Item 2); its
                pressure is lowered and its volume increased. The flow of dry air through the drying bed (Item 16)
                reactivates desiccant material by removing the water vapor adhering to it. Fifteen to 30 seconds are
                required for the entire purge volume to flow through the desiccant drying bed (Item 16).
            </para>
            <para>The end cover single check valve assembly (Item 4) prevents air pressure in the brake system from
                returning to the air dryer during the purge cycle. After the 30 second purge cycle is complete, the air
                dryer is ready for the next charge cycle to begin.
            </para>
            <para>The purge valve will remain open after the purge cycle is complete and will not close until air brake
                system pressure is reduced and the governor signals the compressor to charge.

            <para>The function of the turbo cutoff valve is to prevent loss of engine turbocharger air pressure through
                the air dryer in systems where the compressor intake is connected to the engine turbocharger. The turbo
                cutoff valve also reduces the "puffing" of air out the open exhaust when a naturally aspirated, single
                cylinder compressor equipped with an inlet check valve is used on the vehicle.
            </para>
            <para>At the beginning of the purge cycle, the downward travel of the purge piston is stopped when the turbo
                cutoff valve (tapered portion of purge piston) contacts its mating metal seat in the purge valve
                housing. With the turbo cutoff valve seated (closed position), air in the discharge line and inlet port
                is restricted from entering the air dryer. While the turbo cutoff effectively prevents loss of
                turbocharger boost pressure to the engine, some "seepage" of air may be detected under certain
                conditions of compressor engine and turbocharger operation, even though there will be low pressure air
                trapped in the discharge line.
