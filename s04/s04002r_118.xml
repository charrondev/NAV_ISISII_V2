            <para>The primary purpose of the System Saver 1000 Air Dryer (
                <hotlnk xrefid="f0400271">Figure 71</hotlnk>
                ) is to collect and remove air system contaminants in solid, liquid and vapor form before the air enters
                the brake system. It provides clean dry air to the components of the brake system.

            <para>The System Saver 1000 Air Dryer consists of an Air Dryer base, the aluminum casting to which all air
                dryer components are assembled and in which the threaded mounting holes are incorporated. The Bypass
                Valve is located between the inlet and outlet ports. This valve allows the air flow into the air dryer
                to bypass the desiccant cartridge and go directly to the outlet port of the air dryer. The Desiccant
                Cartridge is a steel housing that contains the filter elements and the desiccant necessary to filter and
                dry the air that passes through it. It has a spin-on and spin-off design (like an oil filter) that
                allows for quick and easy maintenance.
            </para>
            <para>The Heater Assembly is a device that is located in the air dryer base to prevent freezing of the water
                that is collected in the air dryer. This assembly consists of a cylindrical resistive-type heating
                element and a small circular thermostat. The thermostat controls the operation of the heater element and
                maintains the temperature of the air dryer base above freezing (32 degrees F).
            </para>
            <para>The Outlet Check Valve is located in the outlet port of the air dryer. This valve prevents air in the
                air system from flowing back through the air dryer and escaping out the purge valve during the
                compressor unload cycle. The Purge Valve is located on the bottom of the air dryer base. This valve
                allows the collected moisture, condensation and contamination to be expelled from the air dryer during
                the purge cycle.
            </para>
            <para>The Regeneration Valve controls regeneration by allowing air from the supply and secondary tanks to
                bypass the outlet check valve, flow into the regeneration valve, and then through an orifice where air
                expands and "backflushes" moisture off the desiccant and then out through the purge valve.
            </para>
            <para>The Silencer (an optional feature) is attached to the purge valve. When installed, this device
                eliminates most of the noise associated with the air dryer purge.
            </para>
            <para>The Turbo Cut-Off Valve is located in the inlet port of the air dryer. This device closes the path
                between the air compressor and the air dryer purge valve during the compressor unload cycle.

                <title>Drying Cycle</title>
            </para>
            <para>During system pressure build-up (compressing air), compressed air passes into the air dryer where the
                filter system removes contaminants and passes the air into the drying cycle. Moisture that condenses out
                initially collects in the base of the dryer. The moisture laden air passes through the desiccant bed,
                where the remaining moisture is retained by the desiccant. The drying cycle begins and ends the same as
                the compressor load cycle.
            </para>
            <para>The air dryer will remain in the drying cycle until the air brake system pressure builds to the
                governor cut-out setting.
            </para>
            <para>
                <title>Purge Cycle</title>
            </para>
            <para>When the air brake system pressure reaches the cut-out setting of the governor, the compressor unloads
                (air compression stopped), the purge valve opens allowing the initial decompression of the dryer (purge)
                and expels the water collected in the base of the dryer. The purge valve remains open during the
                compressor unload cycle. The regeneration valve then allows a mild back flow of air through the air
                dryer and out the purge valve that begins immediately after the purge and lasts normally 8 to 15
                seconds. This back flow of air from the air system and through the air dryer removes moisture from the
                desiccant cartridge and readies the air dryer for the next compressor load cycle.
            </para>
            <para>Regeneration continues until the regeneration valve senses that the pressure of the back flow air
                entering the regeneration valve has dropped 10 psi from the initial pressure of the back flow air when
                regeneration began. Therefore, when regeneration is complete, the pressure in the supply tank and
                secondary tank is 10 psi less than cut-out pressure. This is normal and unique to the System Saver 1000
                Air Dryer. This cycle starts at the beginning of the compressor unload cycle and normally ends well
                before the beginning of the compressor load cycle.
            </para>
            <para>The bypass valve allows the air flow into the air dryer to bypass the desiccant cartridge and go
                directly to the outlet port of the air dryer. This will occur whenever the air passages in the desiccant
                cartridge and/or purge valve area become plugged due to contamination and/or freezing. Obviously, the
                air does not get dried in this mode, but the air compressor, air dryer and the air compressor discharge
                line are protected from damage due to an over-pressure condition.
            </para>
            <para>
                <title>Turbo Cut-Off Valve</title>
            </para>
            <para>The function of the turbo cut-off valve is to close the path between the air compressor and the air
                dryer purge valve during the compressor unload cycle. This prevents the portion of turbocharger boost
                pressure which passes by the air compressor during the compressor unload cycle from leaking out of the
                purge valve, thereby maintaining boost pressure for maximum engine horsepower during the compressor
                unload cycle.

                    <para>Before replacing any air dryer component, make sure that the air compressor and air governor
                        are in good working order. Repair or replace these parts if needed. Check the entire air system
                        for leaks and repair as needed. Also, when draining air tanks before servicing the air dryer,
                        check for water and/or oil that may have accumulated in the tanks.
