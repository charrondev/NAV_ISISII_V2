            <para>The Cyclo-Gard air dryer is a heat transfer type air dryer that cools compressed air pumped from the
                compressor to ambient temperature before it enters the supply reservoir. It is also designed to prevent
                water, oil, carbon and sludge from entering the braking system air supply.

            <para>A thermostatically controlled heater is provided to keep moisture from freezing inside the dryer or
                drain valve during cold weather operation.

            <para>A check valve is provided in the discharge port of the dryer to permit depressurizing the dryer
                without draining the air system.

            <para>Air leaves the sump through the exit tube and is directed by the baffle to flow against the tube wall.
                The heat of compression is dissipated through the tube and the cooling fins, and the air temperature
                drops rapidly from as high as 500 degrees F to about 10 degrees above ambient temperature.

                that may remain. Clean, dry air then leaves the dryer through the check valve to the supply reservoir.

            <para>When system air pressure builds to governed pressure, the air compressor governor will unload the
                compressor and, at the same time, the governor directs system air pressure to the air dryer unloading
                valve which causes the valve to open. When the unloading valve opens, the check valve in the dryer
                discharge port will close, and air in the dryer will escape out the unloader valve (
                <hotlnk xrefid="f0400284">Figure 84</hotlnk>
                ). Moisture and other contaminants will be carried out the exhaust port of the unloader valve by the

                ON when the thermostatic temperature falls below 35 degrees F and automatically turn OFF when the
                thermostatic temperature rises above 75 degrees F. To test the heater, disconnect the unit and place it
                in a cup of ice water for five minutes. Reconnect the heater. The heater should heat up and continue
                heating until the thermostat reaches 75 degrees F. At 75 degrees F, the heater should turn itself OFF. A
                heater unit that fails to perform as described above should be replaced.

                    unloader valve exhaust port. To determine the source of the condition, disconnect the air line at
                    the unloader valve cap. If the valve does not close, it should be repaired or replaced. If it does
                    close, it is functioning properly and the governor may be faulty.
