            <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
            <para>The air compressor governor, along with the compressor unloader mechanism, automatically limits system
                pressure to a predetermined range by opening unloading valves and stopping compression when system
                pressure has been built up to maximum pressure limit, and by closing unloading valves and starting
                compression when system pressure has dropped to minimum pressure limit.

            <para>The D-2 governor (
                <hotlnk xrefid="f0400287">Figure 87</hotlnk>
                ) has a piston upon which air pressure acts to overcome the pressure setting spring and control the
                inlet and exhaust valve to either admit or exhaust air to or from the compressor unloader mechanism.

            <para>The governor can be attached to the compressor or mounted remotely. It is adaptable to either
                mounting. Connections in this system are to the reservoir and compressor unloader ports. It also has an
                exhaust port.
