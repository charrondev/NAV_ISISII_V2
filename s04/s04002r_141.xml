        <title>SUPERCHARGED COMPRESSOR INDUCTION</title>
        <para>This kit is used when the compressor inlet receives its air supply from the engine supercharger.</para>
        <para>This kit employs two adapters "A" with a gasket "B" between them (
            <hotlnk xrefid="f0400291">Figure 91</hotlnk>
            ). Through the orifice in the gasket, a differential is created. (The pressure on the compressor side of the
            gasket "B" is less than the pressure on the inlet fitting side of gasket "B.") The alcohol will be induced
            through line "C" into the compressor inlet and thus into the air brake system. The choke filling "D" (
            <hotlnk xrefid="f0400291">Figure 91</hotlnk>
            ) prohibits a quick change of pressure in the alcohol jar when a momentary vacuum is created in the
            compressor air induction line by the engine and prohibits evacuation of alcohol from the jar. Maximum safe
            operating pressure is 5 psi.
