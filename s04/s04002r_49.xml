            <para>The text and illustrations contained in this section pertain to the treadle type (foot) brake valve.
                The treadle and suspended type valves differ in that the suspended pedal valve is turned over and the
                valve body is equipped with an exhaust port at a 90 degree angle at the top.

            <title>Applying Normal Operations - Secondary Circuit Portion of (Foot) Brake Valve</title>
            <para>When the primary inlet valve is moved off its seat, air is permitted to pass through the bleed passage
                and enters the relay cavity. Air pressure moves the relay piston. The relay piston, which contains the
                exhaust seat, closes the secondary exhaust valve. As the secondary exhaust valve closes, the secondary
                inlet valve is moved off its seat, allowing secondary air pressure to flow out the secondary delivery
                port. Because of the small volume of air required to move the relay piston, action of the secondary
                circuit portion of the valve is almost simultaneous with the primary circuit.

            <para>Should air be lost in the primary circuit, the function will be as follows. As the brake pedal is
                depressed and no air pressure is present in the primary circuit supply and delivery ports, the primary
                piston will mechanically move the relay piston, allowing the piston to close the secondary exhaust
                valve, open the secondary inlet valve, and allow air pressure to flow out the secondary delivery port (

            <para>When air pressure delivered to the brake actuators and air pressure in the cavity of the delivery side
                of the primary piston equals the mechanical force of the brake pedal application, the primary piston

                supply line through the valve. The exhaust valve remains closed preventing any escape of air through the

                further flow of air pressure from the supply line through the valve. The exhaust remains closed as the
                secondary supply pressure balances the secondary delivery pressure (
