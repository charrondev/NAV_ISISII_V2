            <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
            <para>The function of the Quick Release Valve is to "speed up" the exhaust of air from the brake chambers.
                It is generally mounted on the vehicle axle midway between the two brake chambers connected to it.
            </para>
            <para>In the standard QR-N (
                <hotlnk xrefid="f0400227">Figure 27</hotlnk>
                ), a flat circular diaphragm is installed between the non-metallic upper body and stamped steel lower
                body. An O-ring seals the two body halves, which are held together with four 1/4" machine screws and
                flange nuts. The steel lower body also serves as the valve mounting bracket. In its standard
                configuration (
                <hotlnk xrefid="f0400228">Figure 28</hotlnk>
                ), the QR-N is supplied with a 1 psi maximum differential.

            <para>A higher differential pressure valve (3 psi) is available for special applications. The higher
                differential pressure is obtained by the addition of a spring and diaphragm follower to the standard
                QR-N. Refer to

            <para>The difference between a standard QR-N or differential QR-N valve can be determined by following one

                <para count="1">Scrape paint from the valve surface. If the color of the plastic is gray, it is a
                    differential valve.

            <step1>
                <para count="1">Remove the fitting from the outlet port. If there is a spring inside the port, it is a
                    differential valve.

                    the valve lists the valve operating pressure.
