            <para>The modular control valve (
                <hotlnk xrefid="f0400239">Figure 39</hotlnk>
                ) is a two-button, push-pull control valve housed in a single body which includes a dual circuit supply
                valve and a check valve. The valve body, plungers and spools are made of a non-metallic, non-corrosive
                material. All connections are at the back of the valve except for the auxiliary port as illustrated in
                <hotlnk xrefid="f0400240">Figure 40</hotlnk>

            </step1>
            <para>The valve includes a spring loaded dual circuit supply double check valve. The valve selects the air
                source for both control valve circuits. The primary reservoir is selected at all times unless the
                pressure in the primary reservoir falls more than 30 psi below the pressure of the secondary reservoir.
            </para>
            <para>If the pressure in the primary reservoir falls more than 30 psi below the pressure of the secondary
                reservoir, the dual circuit supply valve will shuttle and establish the secondary reservoir as the
                supply.
            </para>
            <para>The trailer air supply valve or tractor protection control (red knob),
                <hotlnk xrefid="f0400239">Figure 39</hotlnk>
                , delivers air to the trailer supply line and also will trip (pop out) automatically and shut off the
                trailer supply if pressure decreases to 40 &#177; 5 psi.
            </para>
            <specpara>
                <important>
                    <para>Reservoir No. 1 must be the reservoir that supplies the primary brake system. Reservoir No. 2
                        must be the reservoir that supplies the secondary brake system.

            <para>The parking brake valve (yellow knob),
                <hotlnk xrefid="f0400239">Figure 39</hotlnk>
                , controls the spring brakes on the tractor and when exhausted, simultaneously causes the trailer supply
                valve to trip and exhaust, thus applying both tractor and trailer parking brakes as required by Federal
                Regulations. The trailer brakes may be independently released by pushing only the trailer air supply
                valve (red knob) in.
