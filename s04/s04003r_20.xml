        <svcsubsecinfo>
            <para>The following disassembly and assembly procedure is presented for reference purposes and presupposes
                that a major rebuild of the compressor is being undertaken. Several maintenance kits are available which
                do not require full disassembly. When servicing this compressor with a maintenance kit, all components
                contained in the kit must be used. The instructions provided with these parts and kits should be
                followed in lieu of the instructions presented here.
            </para>
            <para>Remove road dirt and grease from the exterior of the compressor with a cleaning solvent. Before the
                compressor is disassembled, the following items should be marked to show their relationship when the
                compressor is assembled. Mark the rear end cover in relation to the crankcase. Mark the base plate or
                base adapter in relation to the crankcase.
            </para>
            <para>A convenient method to indicate the above relationships is to use a metal scribe to mark the parts
                with numbers or lines. Do not use marking methods such as chalk that can be wiped off or obliterated
                during rebuilding.
