        <title>INTAKE AND COMPRESSION OF AIR (LOADED)</title>
        <para>During the down stroke of the piston, a slight vacuum is created between the top of the piston and the
            head, causing the flat circular inlet valve to move off its seat. (Note the flat square discharge valve
            remains on its seat.) Atmospheric air is drawn into the intake cavity and flows past the open inlet valve
            and into the cylinder (
            <hotlnk xrefid="f0400404">Figure 4</hotlnk>). As the piston begins its upward stroke, the air that was drawn
            into the cylinder on the down stroke is compressed. Air pressure on the inlet valve plus the force of its
            spring, returns the inlet valve to its seat. As the piston continues its upward stroke, air is compressed
            and forces the discharge valve away from its seat. Air flows past the open discharge valve into the
            discharge line and on to the reservoirs (
            <hotlnk xrefid="f0400405">Figure 5</hotlnk>).

        <para>As the piston reaches the top of its stroke and starts down, the discharge valve spring and air pressure
            in the discharge line returns the discharge valve to its seat. This prevents the compressed air in the
            discharge line from returning to the cylinder bore as the intake and compression cycle is repeated.
