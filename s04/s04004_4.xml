        <title>NON-COMPRESSION OF AIR (UNLOADED)</title>
        <para>When air pressure in the reservoir reaches the cut-out setting of the governor, the governor allows air to
            flow from the reservoir into the unloader piston cavity (

        <para>The unloader piston moves, in response to air pressure, and drives the inlet valve away from its seat and
            holds it against its stop.
        </para>
        <para>With the inlet valve held away from its seat, air compression is stopped an air is free to move back and
            forth past the inlet valve in response to piston travel. System pressure will eventually drop to the cut-in
            pressure setting of the governor due to air usage. When the cut-in pressure is reached, the governor
            responds by exhausting air from the unloader piston cavity. Spring force moves the unloader piston away from
            the inlet valve and compression is resumed as the inlet valve returns to its seat.
