                    While observing the duplex gauge, apply the service brake control moderately to at least 30 psi (207
                    kPa). The moderate rate of application should simulate that used in day-to-day braking under normal

                    tractor brakes, the gauge reading should be recorded as a positive (+) number. If the pressure
                    build-up lags, the reading should be recorded as a negative (-) number. Release the service brakes.

            <para>The Pressure Balance and Pressure Build-up Rate Test also can be used for checking combination

                to read brake pressures at the rearmost axles of the tractor and the first trailer. A second duplex test
                gauge is installed to read pressure at the dolly axle and the rearmost axle of the second trailer (
                <hotlnk xrefid="f0400821">Figure 21</hotlnk>). Two additional air hoses may be required to make the
                gauge connections at the second trailer in order to keep both duplex gauges at one observation point.
                The test is then conducted as described, noting and recording the pressure differentials and build-up
                times obtained from the four sources - the rearmost axles of the tractor and first trailer, and the
