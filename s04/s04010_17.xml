        <title>CRANKCASE</title>
        <para>Scrape all gasket material from crankcase mounting surface and cylinder head mounting. Clean all carbon
            and dirt from inlet and unloader passages. Use compressed air to blow excessive dirt and carbon deposits
            from unloader passages. Clean all oil passages in crankcase.
        </para>
        <para>Inspect crankcase surfaces for cracks and damage.</para>
        <para>On compressors with ball bearing main bearings, the difference between the O.D. of the outer race and the
            I.D. of the crankcase bore should be .0000 - .0015 inch (.000 - .0381mm) loose to maintain the correct press
            fit. Replace crankcase if the fit is too loose.
        </para>
        <para>On compressors with sleeve-type main bearings, the difference between the O.D. of the crankshaft journal
            and main bearing I.D. must not exceed .0065 inch (.1651mm). If clearance is greater than .0065 inch
            (.1651mm), the end cover or main bearing must be replaced.
        </para>
        <para>Check the unloader bore bushings to be sure they are not worn, rusted or damaged. If bushings are to be
            replaced, they can be removed by running a 1/8" pipe thread tap into the bushing and inserting a 1/8" pipe
            threaded rod and pulling the bushing straight up and out. Do not use an easy-out for removing these
            bushings. If inlet valve seats are worn or damaged, so they cannot be reclaimed by facing, they should be
            replaced.

        <para>Cylinder bores should be checked with an inside micrometer or calipers (

        <para>Cylinder bores which are scored or out-of- round by more than .001 inch (.0254mm) or tapered more than
            .002 inch (.0508mm) should be rebored or honed oversize. Over-sized pistons and piston rings are available
            in .010 inch (.2540mm), .020 inch (.5080 mm) and .030 inch (.7620mm) oversizes. Cylinder bores must be
            smooth, straight and round. Clearance between cast iron pistons and cylinder bores should be between .002
            inch (.0508mm) minimum and .004 inch (.1016mm) maximum (
