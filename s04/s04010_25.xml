                <para>All flange mounted compressors must be assembled without a gasket between the crankcase and flange
                    adapter and some compressors do not require gaskets on the end cover. Install the new crankcase
                    gaskets only where they were removed during disassembly. Failure of the compressor would result if
                    gaskets are used when not required.

            <para count="1">On compressors which use a ball type main bearing, press the ball bearing onto the correct
                end of the crankshaft. Position the ball bearing and the crankshaft in the crankcase making sure the
                drive end of the crankshaft is positioned in the crankcase as marked before disassembly. Carefully press
                the crankshaft and ball bearing into the crankcase using an arbor press.

            <para count="1">On compressors with a front ball bearing, place two small seal rings in the countersunk
                holes at the front of the crankcase, as well as an end cover gasket. Install the front end cover in
                proper position as marked before disassembly taking care not to damage the new oil seal.

            <para count="1">On compressors with a rear ball bearing, place two small seal rings in countersunk at the
                rear of the crankcase. In one application a gasket is used and in another a large O-ring is placed in
                the counterbore at the rear of the crankcase. These are in addition to the seal rings. Install the rear
                end cover in the proper position as marked before disassembly. On some compressors the area for the two
                small seal rings has been increased slightly and the seal ring thickness increased. When the thicker
                O-rings are used, a retaining ring will also be used as shown in
                <hotlnk xrefid="f0401015">Figure 15</hotlnk>.

                compressors will have the wrist pin secured in the piston by a lock wire extending through matching
                holes in wrist pin and piston boss, anchored in a hole in the side wall of the piston. If the original
                pistons are used, the wrist pin must be pressed in so the hole in the wrist pin aligns with that of the
                piston. Secure same by inserting the new lockwire through the hole in piston and wrist pin and lock the
                wire by snapping the short 90 degree section into the lockwire hole in the bottom of the piston.

                pistons in the kit are prelubricated with a special lubricant and require no further lubrication.
                Install unloader pistons in their bores taking care not to cut O-ring. Position unloader plungers in
                their guides and slip them in and over the tops of the pistons. Install unloader spring seat in
                crankcase inlet cavity. A small hole is drilled in crankcase for this purpose. Position the saddle
                between unloader piston guides so its forks are centered on guides. Install unloader spring making sure
                it seats over the spring seats both in crankcase and on saddle. Install inlet valve guides, then
                position valves in their guides. There should be a loose sliding fit between the guides and valves.

                the bottom of the spring bore in the head. Should this procedure fail after repeated attempts, use a
                very small quantity of grease to hold them in place, just enough to keep the springs from falling out.
                Place the cylinder head gasket on the cylinder block. Carefully align the cylinder head assembly on the
                block and install the capscrews, tightening them evenly to a torque of 25 - 30 ft-lbs. (34 - 40.7 N&#8226;m).
