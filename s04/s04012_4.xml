                air moves through a passage in the cover to the top of the service relay piston. In response to air

                With the exhaust passage sealed, continued movement of the piston unseats the inlet portion of the inlet
                and exhaust valve, allowing supply air from the reservoir to flow out the BP-R1 delivery ports to the
                brake chambers.

            <para>When the brake application is released, air pressure in the service port of the BP-R1 returns to the
                brake control valve (foot valve) and is exhausted. Air from above the relay piston flows back through
                the proportioning, blend back and service pistons to the exhaust diaphragm. If the service brakes are
                rapidly released, the diaphragm flexes in response to the returning air and opens the exhaust. If the
                brakes are slowly released, service air pressure will flow through the slot behind the diaphragm and
                back to the brake control valve (foot valve). As air pressure is reduced above the relay piston,
                pressure beneath it lifts the piston away from the exhaust valve and opens the exhaust passage. Air from
                the service brake chambers returns to the BP-R1 and flows out the open exhaust.

            <para>When the trailer air supply valve (dash control with red octagonal button) is pulled out to disconnect
                the trailer, air in the BP-R1 control port and trailer supply line is exhausted to atmosphere. During
                bobtail tractor operation, service application air enters the BP-R1 service port causing the exhaust
                diaphragm to seal the exhaust port. Service application air passing through the blend back piston exerts
                a force on the full effective diameter of the piston. The blend back piston remains stationary at
                application pressures below approximately 80 psi because of opposing reservoir air acting on the large
                diameter. Application air flowing through the blend back piston also exerts force on the small diameter
                of the proportioning piston while simultaneously flowing through the center of it on its way to the
                inlet and exhaust valve. Service air pressure exerts a force on the larger diameter end of the
                proportioning piston, which opposes the air pressure and spring force exerted on the other end. The
                proportioning piston inlet valve remains open until a preset, initial application pressure has reached
                the relay piston assuring that the foundation brake shoes are brought into contact with the drum. As
                service pressure begins to exceed the preset initial application, the proportioning piston will move
                sufficiently to close its inlet valve without opening the exhaust.
            </para>
            <para>As service air pressure continues to increase, the inlet valve opens as necessary to deliver
                additional, but reduced air pressure to the relay piston, thus to the rear axle brakes. Proportioning
                occurs due to the difference in effective area on each end of the proportioning piston.
            </para>
            <para>Service applications of more than 80 psi cause the blend back piston to begin to move. Service air
                pressure acting on the full diameter of the blend back piston overcomes the resistance of reservoir
                pressure acting on the large diameter of the other side. Above 80 psi, the difference between control
                and delivered air pressure is reduced and "blends back" from a proportioned delivery to a full 1:1
                delivery. Complete "blend back" to a 1:1 delivery is achieved when a full brake application is made, and
                it will occur regardless of reservoir pressure level.

            <para>When the brake application is released, air pressure in the service port of the BP-R1 returns to the

                valve and the service piston returns to the exhaust diaphragm. If the release is rapid, the diaphragm

            <para>Air from above the relay piston flows back to the proportioning piston, causing it to move. As the

                lift the piston away from the exhaust valve. Air from the service brake chambers returns to the BP-R1
                and flows out the open exhaust.
