        <title>SPRING BRAKE</title>
        <para>The spring actuated tandem-type parking brake consists of two connected cylinders. The two cylinders are
            the spring brake chamber and service brake chamber (
            <hotlnk xrefid="f0401310">Figure 10</hotlnk>).

        <para>When 70 psi or more air pressure is applied against the piston, the spring is held in a compressed
            position. When air pressure is removed, the spring pushes the piston against the diaphragm plate and applies
            the parking brake.
        </para>
        <para>All spring brake assemblies are equipped with manual caging bolts to permit safe handling (
            <hotlnk xrefid="f0401311">Figure 11</hotlnk>). The spring brake must be caged before any service is
            performed.

            <warning>
                <para>The spring brake assemblies must be caged before starting any removal of wheels or drums or
                    servicing air chamber non-pressure half. After parts are reassembled and in place, uncage the spring
                    brake assembly prior to returning the vehicle to service. If disabled vehicle has lost its air
                    pressure, the wheel must be blocked and the spring brake chamber caged prior to moving the vehicle.
                </para>
                <para>International does not recommend disassembly of spring brake chambers. The sudden release of the
                    power spring could cause serious personal injury. The spring brake chamber must be replaced as an
                    assembly if its condition is questionable.

        <para>The breather cap may be removed (for cleaning) after caging the spring brake assembly. The non-pressure
            half, diaphragm push rod and clamp ring should be serviced as described in
