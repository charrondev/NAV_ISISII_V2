        <svcsubsecinfo>
            <para>The hydraulic brake actuation system includes a Hydro-Max&#8482; booster assembly, master cylinder
                assembly, backup pump and monitor module. The monitor module is located inside the cab under the
                instrument panel (
                <hotlnk xrefid="f0401701">Figure 1</hotlnk>).
            </para>
            <para>Additional conditions affecting the electrical operation of the brake monitoring system and backup
                pump can be found in GROUP 08 - ELECTRICAL in the CTS-5000 Master Service Manual.

                <note>
                    <para>Some models prior to 1990, have a wire lead from the backup pump instead of the terminal
                        shown.

                for all items in parentheses.
            </para>
            <para>The on-vehicle repair of the Hydro-Max&#8482; booster or the master cylinder is limited to replacement
                of the backup pump (Item 2), flow switch (Item 3), relay (Item 4) and pressure differential switch (Item
                7).
            </para>
            <para>The master cylinder (Item 6) may be separated from the Hydro-Max&#8482; booster (Item 1) for master
                cylinder replacement or to permit removing the Hydro-Max&#8482; booster from the vehicle without
                removing the master cylinder or disconnecting the hydraulic brake fluid lines.

                <warning>
                    <para>When adding fluids, take care to identify fluids (power steering fluid or brake fluid) and use
                        only in the proper system. Discard all fluid bled or drained from either system. Do not use for
                        refill, cleaning or any other purpose. Failure to observe these precautions could result in
                        failure of the brake system, with resultant personal injury and/or property damage.

                for all items in parentheses.
            </para>
            <para>If both the Hydro-Max&#8482; booster (Item 1) primary hydraulic system and the backup pump (Item 2)
                are not functioning, the brakes are still functional as non-power assisted hydraulic brakes. The brake
                pedal effort is transmitted directly through the booster from the brake pedal rod (Item 10) to the
                master cylinder pistons, manually applying the brakes. The brakes are operational but stopping distance
                is greatly increased due to the reduced force the operator is able to apply to the master cylinder.
            </para>
            <para>The brake calipers and rotors and ABS control units are an integral part of the hydraulic brake
                system, but servicing them is covered separately. Refer to GROUP 04 - BRAKES in the CTS-5000 Master
                Service Manual for the vehicle being serviced.
