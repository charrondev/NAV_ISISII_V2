                            <para>Studies have indicated that exposure to excessive amounts of brake material dust
                                (whether asbestos or non-asbestos, fiberglass, mineral wool, aramid, ceramic or carbon)
                                may be a potential cancer-causing health hazard. Even though the Occupational Safety and
                                Health Administration (OSHA) has not set any limits on non-asbestos dust exposure, there
                                is some medical opinion that such non-asbestos fibers can cause cancer as well. Since
                                most automotive friction materials normally contain a sizeable amount of this material,
                                it is important that people who handle brake linings be aware of the problem and know
                                the precautions to be taken.

                                recommends that you use cylinders that enclose the brake. These cylinders have vacuums
                                with high efficiency (HEPA) filters and worker's arm sleeves. But, if such equipment is
                                not available, carefully clean parts and assemblies in the open air.

                                cleaner with a HEPA filter system to clean dust from the brake drums, backing plates and
                                other brake parts. After using the vacuum, remove any remaining dust with a rag soaked
