            <title>Diagnosing and Locating a System Problem: Self-Diagnostics</title>
            <para>The EC-15 contains self-test and diagnostic circuitry that continuously checks for proper operation of
                the entire antilock system, including wiring continuity. A yellow warning light located on the
                instrument panel, controlled by the EC-15, advises the driver of the condition of the entire antilock
                system. The condition of specific antilock components is provided to the mechanic by a series of
                labeled, Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) displayed through a window in the EC-15 housing.
            </para>
            <para>No special tools or equipment are needed to read or interpret the EC-15 diagnostics window. It should
                be noted that the EC-15 diagnostics display is separate from the yellow antilock condition light on the
                dash. With this separation, the driver is aware that a problem has occurred, but is not confused by the
                diagnostic information.
            </para>
            <para>A special feature of the EC-15 controller is the failure latching and diagnostic system. Intermittent
                problems, particularly in the wheel speed sensing area can be difficult to diagnose. When the controller
                senses an erroneous condition, whether in the controller electronics, the modulator or wheel speed
                sensing areas, it stores the condition in non-volatile memory, disables the antilock function,
                illuminates the dash mounted antilock condition light and the appropriate diagnostic LEDs on the EC-15.
            </para>
            <para>The failure condition is truly stored and is not cleared by loss of power to the EC-15. The LEDs will
                re-light when power is restored and remain illuminated until the failure is corrected. After the actual
                problem is corrected, maintenance personnel can clear or reset the EC-15 diagnostics by passing a small
                magnet over the RESET point in the diagnostics window.
