            . During a normal, relatively "slow" brake release, air moves back through the M-21 in the reverse direction
            as it flowed during application. The internal components of the M-21 will remain in the same position as
            they assumed during application until air pressure decreases to approximately one half psi, at which time
            the supply diaphragm will seat on the supply passage. Air will generally not be expelled from the M-21
            exhaust port during normal brake release.

            . The Rapid Exhaust operation described in the following text
            <emph type="bold">only occurs when the M-21 is controlling two, type 30 (or larger) service chambers</emph>.
            During a very rapid brake release, the M-21 will exhaust air in a different manner. An example of this would
            be if the driver made a severe brake application, then lifted his foot from the brake pedal (released foot
            valve). During a rapid brake release, air from the exhaust diaphragm flows back through the open exhaust
            solenoid and to the application device's exhaust. With pressure removed from the control side of the exhaust
            diaphragm, air, returning to the M-21 from the service chambers, opens the exhaust diaphragm. Returning air
            flows past the open exhaust and out the the M-21 exhaust port. Air will also flow past the open supply
            diaphragm and back to the application device's exhaust.
