            <title>Controller (ECU)</title>
            <para>The ECU controller houses the electronic control unit that regulates the functions of the antilock
                system. The ECU performs a system start-up self diagnostic test whenever the vehicle is started and then
                continues to monitor the antilock system performance during operation of the vehicle. The ECU uses the
                yellow instrument panel warning light and the warning light relay to communicate system performance to
                the driver. The ECU also incorporates a diagnostic LED window in the assembly to provide additional
                system diagnostic information. See

                .
            </para>
            <para>The ECU controller mounts on the antilock relay valve with four capscrews. The ECU is electrically
                connected through a 12 - pin and 14 - pin connector to the wheel sensors, brake modulators, and the cab
                antilock wire harness. The antilock relay valve functions as a service brake relay valve and contains no
                electronics of its own.

            <para>The ECU assembly is supplied with electrical power by the vehicle electrical system. Refer to

            <para>The system's (
                <hotlnk xrefid="f0402406">Figure 6</hotlnk>
                ) ignition power source is the battery feed stud. Ignition power feeds on circuit 14C to a 30 amp fuse
                (F2), through circuit 94A to the crank relay (C424). The crank relay is activated when the key switch is
                turned to IGN and power flows to the crank relay using circuit 12/12A/12C and a 10 amp fuse E1. The
                crank relay control coil is grounded through circuit 94-GA. Power is supplied to the ECU through circuit
                94A/94L and is delivered to the harness connector through pin J.
            </para>
            <para>When the key switch is turned to START, the crank relay is de - energized as power from the key switch
                through circuit 12/12A/12C is not present in the START switch position. This avoids the possibility of
                low voltage that sometimes occurs during engine cranking going to the ECU and causing faulty LED
                signals.

            <title>AR-1 Antilock Relay Valve</title>
            <para>The AR - 1 antilock relay valve is a specialized service brake relay valve. The AR - 1 contains no
                electronic components and functions as a brake relay valve. The AR - 1 is essentially an R - 14 relay
                valve with a special cover that permits the direct attachment of the ECU controller. When the controller
                and relay valve are assembled together, the assembly is called a CR - 15 Relay Valve/ECU.

            <para>In the antilock brake system, the AR - 1 relay valve (
                <hotlnk xrefid="f0402407">Figure 7</hotlnk>
                ) serves as a relay station to speed the application and release of the rear service brakes.
                Incorporated within the AR - 1 relay valve is a quick release valve next to the service port, which
                provides for rapid exhausting of control air pressure from above the relay piston. All air connections
                on the relay valve are identified with cast, embossed letters for ease of maintenance. The letter
                identification of the air ports on the AR - 1 is:
