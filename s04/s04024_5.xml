            <para>The antilock system provides individual wheel control by using a wheel speed sensor and modulator at
                each wheel to measure rotational speed. By monitoring the rate of deceleration during braking, and then
                modifying the service brake application pressure at each wheel, the ECU is able to provide improved
                vehicle braking, while maintaining vehicle stability.
            </para>
            <para>The rear axle brakes are controlled completely independent of each other and brake application
                pressure at an individual wheel is adjusted solely on the basis of its behavior on the road surface on
                which it is traveling.

            <title>Front (Steering) Axle Brake Operation</title>
            <para>While each steering axle brake is under the control of an individual modulator valve, the ECU does not
                treat these brakes totally independent of each other. The ECU utilizes a modified individual control
                method for steering axle brakes. This is done to minimize "steering wheel pull" in the event that one
                front wheel is on dry pavement and the other is on a slippery surface, such as ice or snow. The ECU
                controls the braking force differences between the two brakes. The wheel on dry pavement is initially
                given less braking force and is brought up to optimum during the stop, while the wheel on ice attempts
                to maintain optimum braking during the entire stop.
