                        <caption>Figure 1. Typical Antilock/Traction Control Brake System</caption>
                    </figure>
                    <para>This service section covers the Antilock brake system installed as a stand-alone system, ABS
                        with Engine Brake, and ABS with Traction Control system.
                    </para>
                    <para>During a brake stop, the maximum point of deceleration occurs just before wheel lockup. When
                        wheel lockup occurs, stopping distances increase and loss of directional control may occur.
                    </para>
                    <para>To reduce wheel lockup, the antilock brake system monitors the rotational speed of the wheels
                        using sensors mounted on the axle ends and exciter rings mounted on the wheel assemblies.
                    </para>
                    <para>When the wheels rotate, an AC voltage pulse is generated by the sensors that is transmitted to
                        the electronic control unit, which is part of the controller/valve assembly. The controller
                        monitors the pulse rates. During a brake application, if an imbalance is sensed (a wheel is
                        about to lock up), the EC-15 controller sends a signal to the appropriate M-21 modulator valve.
                    </para>
                    <para>Within a fraction of a second, the modulator valve responds by repeatedly exhausting air from
                        the brake chamber(s), allowing the wheel(s) to speed up, and then automatically applying air
                        (much like a driver pumping the brakes manually).
                    </para>
                    <para>The antilock system only operates when the controller determines that there is an imbalance (a
                        wheel is about to lock up).
                    </para>
                    <para>The ABS warning light on the instrument panel illuminates when the controller detects a
                        problem with the system.
                    </para>
                    <para>The four-channel antilock brake system controls the rear axle brakes (both axles with 6x4) and
                        the front (steering) axle. Wheel sensors are installed on:

                    </seqlist>
                    <para>The front axle has an M-21 modulator valve for each wheel, so that each front wheel/brake
                        assembly is independently controlled by the CR-15 Controller/Relay Valve. The CR-15 is an
                        assembly made up of an AR-1 Antilock Relay and a EC-15 Electronic Controller.
                    </para>
                    <para>The rear axle has a separate M-21 modulator valve for the right and left side of the vehicle.
                        With a 6x4, the left modulator valve would control the forward left rear and left rear rear axle
                        brakes, and the right side modulator valve controls the right forward rear and right rear rear
                        brakes. The controller/relay valve controls both front M-21 modulator valves and the two M-21
                        modulator valves for the rear axle(s).

                        <para>The antilock system provides individual wheel control by using a wheel speed sensor and
                            modulator at each wheel to measure rotational speed. By monitoring the rate of deceleration
                            during braking, and then modifying the service brake application pressure at each wheel, the
                            controller is able to provide improved vehicle braking, while maintaining vehicle stability.
                        </para>
                        <para>The rear axle brakes are controlled completely independent of each other and brake
                            application pressure at an individual wheel is adjusted solely on the basis of its behavior
                            on the road surface on which it is traveling.

                        <title>Rear Axle Brakes With 6x4 Chassis</title>
                        <para>With vehicles equipped with tandem rear axles (6x2 or 6x4), the wheel speed sensors are
                            installed at the wheel ends on the axle most likely to lose traction first. With a
                            <emph type="bold">4-spring suspension</emph>, the rear axle sensors are located on the
                            Forward Rear axle. On an
                            <emph type="bold">air suspension</emph>, sensors are located on the Rear Rear axle. A single
                            M-21 modulator controls both left side rear axle brakes and another M-21 modulator controls
                            both right side rear axle brakes. With this arrangement of wheel speed sensors and
                            modulators, both brakes on one side of a tandem rear axle will be modulated as one, since
                            they will most likely be on the same type of road surface.

                        <title>Front (Steering) Axle Brakes</title>
                        <para>While each steering axle brake is under the control of an individual M-21 modulator valve,
                            the controller does not treat these brakes totally independent of each other. The controller
                            utilizes a modified individual control method for steering axle brakes. This is done to
                            minimize "steering wheel pull" in the event that one front wheel is on dry pavement and the
                            other is on a slippery surface, such as ice or snow. The ABS controller, controls the
                            braking force differences between the two brakes. The wheel on dry pavement is initially
                            given less braking force and is brought up to optimum during the stop, while the wheel on
                            ice attempts to maintain optimum braking during the entire stop.

                    <title>TRACTION CONTROL</title>
                    <para>The traction control system is an extension of the ABS system. The wheel speed sensors not
                        only detect rapid decreases in wheel speed for antilock, but also detect unreasonably high
                        increases for traction control.

                        electronically controlled engines. The differences between an ABS system and an ABS system with

                            <para>With traction control and ABS there is a different combination of controller and relay
                                valve. There are programming differences and there is a traction control solenoid (part
                                of the controller/relay valve assembly) that connects to the rear axle wiring with a
                                two-pin connector at the controller/relay valve.

                    <para>With traction control, a spinning drive wheel is instantly detected and the wheel speed is
                        compared with the other vehicle wheels, both front and rear. The traction control system
                        simultaneously reduces the engine torque setting to a level suitable for the available traction
                        and gently pumps the brake on the spinning wheel. Since the vehicles differential tends to drive
                        the wheel that has the least resistance (wheel on the slipperiest surface), a slight brake
                        application to this wheel only forces the differential to drive the stationary or slowly
                        spinning wheel.
