            <title>Controller</title>
            <para>The controller houses the electronic control unit that regulates the functions of the traction control
                and/or antilock brake system. The controller performs a system start-up self diagnostic test whenever
                the vehicle is started and then continues to monitor the antilock system performance during operation of
                the vehicle. The controller uses the instrument panel ABS warning light and Traction Active light to
                communicate system performance to the driver. The controller has diagnostic LEDs to provide system
                diagnostic information. Refer to

                .
            </para>
            <para>The controller mounts on the antilock relay valve. The controller is electrically connected through
                connectors (355) and (350) to the wheel sensors, brake modulators, and the cab antilock wire harness.
                With traction control an additional 2-way connector (360) connects the rear chassis harness to the
                traction control solenoid (part of the controller/relay valve assembly). The relay valve functions as a
                service brake relay valve and contains no electronics of its own.

            <para>The controller receives battery power from the B1 battery stud through the ABS ignition relay (152).

            <para>Ignition relay (152) has battery power applied to common terminal 30, from the B1 battery stud at all
                times. This circuit is protected by 30A fuse F10-A. The relay is energized by ignition voltage (key ON)
                from ignition adapter (494) on circuit 13W to the relay control coil at terminal 86. The coil is
                grounded at terminal 85, through circuits 94-GA/94-G at (455) ground adapter.
            </para>
            <para>With the relay energized, battery power from relay terminal 87 is applied through the cab and chassis
                harness to controller connector (355) terminals B1, K2 and K3.

            <title>Engine Brake Interface Wiring - Electronic Engines</title>
            <para>With Electronic Engines, the ABS controller is connected to the engine ECM at J1922 data link
                connector (403). The ABS J1922 data link is a twisted pair of wires (Red positive and light Blue wire
                negative), from connector (355) terminals B2 and B3. (Refer to CTS-5000 Master Service Manual, Group 08,
                Electronic Engine Controls.) When the ABS system sends an engine brake disable signal to the engine ECM,
                the engine ECM disables the engine brake. When the disabling signal is no longer present, the engine
                brake operation will resume.

            <title>Engine Brake Interface Wiring - Caterpillar 3406C (Mechanical Engine)</title>
            <para>With the Caterpillar 3406C mechanical engine, Engine Brake Relay (166) is used to disable the engine
                brake. Ignition voltage (key ON) from ignition adapter (494) on circuit 13W/94B/94C is applied to the
                engine brake relay control coil (terminal 85) and to the common terminal 30. The engine brake relay
                normally closed terminal (87A) is connected by circuit 13AF to the engine brake system fuse.
            </para>
            <para>When the ABS engine brake relay (166) is not energized, ignition power passes through the ABS engine
                brake relay (166), providing power for engine brake operation on circuit 13AF.
            </para>
            <para>Engine Brake Relay (166) has ignition voltage applied at all times to control coil terminal 85. The
                ground side of the control coil (terminal 86) is connected through circuit 94J to controller connector
                (355) terminal K1.
            </para>
            <para>The controller disables the engine brake by grounding terminal K1 at connector (355), causing the
                relay to energize, opening the engine brake feed circuit.

                available for this application.

            <title>Antilock/Bob Tail Proportioning Relay Valve</title>
            <para>The antilock relay valve is a specialized service brake relay valve. The valve functions as a brake
                relay valve and provides Bob Tail proportioning as well, if the vehicle is so configured. If traction
                control is included, the antilock relay valve contains an electric solenoid for the feature. Vehicles
                can be configured four ways:

            <para>With each of the above installations a different combination of controller/relay valve is used. The
                porting on the relay valve portion is the same.
            </para>
            <para>The relay valve has a special cover that permits the direct attachment to the controller. When the
                controller and relay valve are assembled together, the assembly is called a controller/relay valve
                assembly.
            </para>
            <para>In the antilock brake system, the controller/relay valve serves as a relay station to speed the
                application and release of the rear service brakes. Incorporated within the relay valve is a quick
                release valve next to the service port, which provides for rapid exhausting of control air pressure from
                above the relay piston. All air connections on the relay valve are identified with cast, embossed
                letters for ease of maintenance. The letter identification of the air ports on the relay valve are
                listed in
