            <para>The M-21 antilock system modulator (
                <hotlnk xrefid="f0402805">Figure 5</hotlnk>) is essentially a high capacity, ON/OFF air valve that
                incorporates a pair of electrical solenoids for control. The solenoids provide the electro-pneumatic
                link between the antilock controller electronics and the air brake system. The M-21 can be used to
                control the braking function (
                <hotlnk xrefid="f0402806">Figure 6</hotlnk>) on an individual wheel or two service actuators (as with
                6x4). The M-21 is the last control valve that air passes through on its way to the service brake
                actuator(s).

                application air enters the Supply port of the M-21 and flows to, and through, the open exhaust solenoid
                then to the exhaust diaphragm. Air pressure, along with spring force, seats the exhaust diaphragm on the
                exhaust passage, thus preventing the escape of service air. Simultaneously, application air flows to the
                supply diaphragm and forces it away from its seat. Air flows past the open supply and out the M-21
                delivery port to the service brake chambers.

            <para>The Rapid Exhaust operation described in the following text only occurs when the M-21 is controlling
                two, type 30 (or larger) service chambers. During a very rapid brake release, the M-21 will exhaust air
                in a different manner. An example of this would be if the driver made a severe brake application, then
                lifted his foot from the brake pedal (released foot valve). During a rapid brake release, air from the
                exhaust diaphragm flows back through the open exhaust solenoid and to the application device's exhaust.
                With pressure removed from the control side of the exhaust diaphragm, air, returning to the M-21 from
                the service chambers, lifts the exhaust diaphragm from its seat. Returning air flows past the open
                exhaust and out the M-21 exhaust port. Air will also flow past the open supply diaphragm and back to the
                application device's exhaust.

            <title>Antilock Operation - General</title>
            <para>If a service brake application is made and the antilock system detects an impending wheel lockup, the
                antilock controller will immediately begin modification of the brake application using the M-21
                modulator.
            </para>
            <para>In order to modify the brake application, the coils of the two solenoid valves contained in the M-21
                are energized or de-energized in a pre-programmed sequence by the antilock controller. When a solenoid
                coil is energized, a shuttle within the solenoid moves, and depending upon the function of the specific
                solenoid, it either opens or closes, thereby causing the exhaust or re-application of air pressure to
                the brake actuator. The solenoids in the M-21 are controlled independently by the antilock controller.
                By opening and closing the solenoid valves in the M-21 modulators, the antilock controller is able to
                simulate what the driver does when he "pumps the brakes." The antilock controller is able to "pump" each
                modulator, along with the brakes connected to it, independently and with far greater speed and accuracy.

            <para>When wheel lockup is detected, or about to occur, the antilock controller simultaneously energizes
                both the supply and exhaust solenoids in the M-21. Energizing the supply solenoid causes its exhaust to
                close and inlet to open. With the inlet of the supply solenoid open, application air is permitted to
                flow to the control side of the supply diaphragm. Air pressure acting on the supply diaphragm causes it
                to close the supply and prevent further delivery of air to the brake chamber.
            </para>
            <para>Energizing the exhaust solenoid closes its inlet and opens its exhaust. By closing the exhaust
                solenoid inlet, application air is prevented from flowing to the control side of the exhaust diaphragm.
                Air pressure which was present on the control side of the exhaust diaphragm flows out the exhaust port
                of the M-21. With control air pressure removed from the exhaust diaphragm, brake application air forces
                the exhaust diaphragm to unseat, which allows it to flow out the M-21 exhaust port. The M-21 will remain
                in the Antilock Exhaust mode until the antilock controller senses that wheel speed has increased. The
                M-21 can enter the Antilock Hold or Re-apply mode from the Antilock Exhaust mode.

            <para>The antilock controller will place the M-21 in the Hold position when it senses that the correct wheel

                position, prior to entering the Re-Apply, when it detects recovery from a locked wheel condition. In
                this mode of operation, the M-21 supply solenoid remains energized, while the exhaust solenoid is

                pressure is prevented. Because the supply solenoid remains energized, the supply diaphragm remains
                seated, thus preventing application air from flowing to the delivery port and out to the brake chamber.

            <title>Antilock Re-Apply</title>
            <para>If the antilock controller senses that wheel speed has increased sufficiently to allow re-application
                of braking pressure, it de-energizes the supply and exhaust solenoids. With both solenoids de-energized,
                the M-21 re-applies air to the brakes in the same manner it did during a Non-Antilock Application.
