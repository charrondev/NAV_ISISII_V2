        <para>Brake application air enters the ATR-2 service port and is conducted to the single check valve. The check
            valve diaphragm flexes in response to application pressure and seals the passage to the open exhaust of the
            traction solenoid. Air flows through the service piston then through the center of both the blend back and
            proportioning pistons to the inlet and exhaust valve. Flowing around the inlet valve, application air moves
            through a passage in the cover to the top of the service relay piston. In response to air pressure, the
            relay piston moves into contact with the exhaust portion of its inlet and exhaust valve.
        </para>
        <para>With the exhaust passage sealed, continued movement of the piston unseats the inlet portion of the inlet
            and exhaust valve, allowing supply air from the reservoir to flow out the ATR-2 delivery ports to the brake
            chambers.
