        <para>The EC-16 receives information from several components in the system and, based on these inputs, issues
            commands or delivers information. Some portions of the EC-16 both receive and deliver commands and
            information (
            <hotlnk document="s04032_2.xml" xrefid="f0403203">Figure 3</hotlnk>).
        </para>
        <para>
            <emph type="bold">Wheel speed information</emph>
            is provided to the EC-16 via a wiring harness from individual wheel speed sensors at or in the vehicle
            wheels (
            <hotlnk xrefid="f0403205">Figure 5</hotlnk>). Working with an exciter or tone ring, wheel speed sensors
            provide information to the EC-16 in the form of an AC signal which varies in voltage and frequency as the
            speed of the wheel increases or decreases. The EC-16 is designed to receive wheel speed information from
            various wheel speed sensor models at the rate of 100 pulses per wheel revolution. The EC-16 is able to
            simultaneously receive, and individually interpret, speed signals from six wheel speed sensors. Vehicle
            drive configuration and whether the traction control feature is in use determines the number of speed
            sensors that must be used. A vehicle with a single rear axle drive (4x2, 4x4, or 6x2) has 4 speed sensors
            for both antilock and traction operation.

        <para>A vehicle with two rear drive axles (6x4) has 4 speed sensors for antilock only operation, but has 6 speed
            sensors for both antilock and traction operation (

            is supplied to the EC-16 from the ignition switch through a fuse or circuit breaker (30 amp). The electrical
            ground for the EC-16 is the vehicle chassis.
