                                    <para>Studies have indicated that exposure to excessive amounts of brake material
                                        dust (whether asbestos or non-asbestos, fiberglass, mineral wool, aramid,
                                        ceramic or carbon) may be a potential cancer-causing health hazard. Even though
                                        the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has not set any limits
                                        on non-asbestos dust exposure, there is some medical opinion that such
                                        non-asbestos fibers can cause cancer as well. Since most automotive friction
                                        materials normally contain a sizeable amount of this material, it is important
                                        that people who handle brake linings be aware of the problem and know the
                                        precautions to be taken.
