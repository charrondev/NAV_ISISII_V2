        <title>INTRODUCTION TO DCI</title>
        <para>The AlliedSignal Diagnostic Communication Interface, or DCI, is an electronic, diagnostic tool for
            locating faults in the EC-17-based antilock system. The DCI can either be used as a "stand alone" diagnostic
            tool or with AlliedSignal's ACom for Windows software.
        </para>
        <para>When used by itself the DCI is capable of locating individual antilock system faults using a series of
            lamps that indicate the faulted device or its wiring and the location on the vehicle.
            <hotlnk xrefid="f0403807">The DCI has 12 LED lamps and a reset switch</hotlnk>. The row of 10 lamps is
            similar to the diagnostic LED display found on some Bendix antilock Controllers. The two other lamps
            indicate that the DCI has a power source and that a communications link is established with the controller.

        <para>When used in conjunction with a personal computer (PC) and AlliedSignal's "ACom For Windows" software
            installed, the DCI becomes a communications arbitrator between the vehicle's numerous onboard controllers
            and the personal computer (PC). In this case all testing and diagnostics are performed by the computer and
            ACom for Windows.
