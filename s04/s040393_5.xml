                    brake pressure is brought up to master cylinder output pressure. The ABS allows the brake fluid to
                    flow to the wheel, to build pressure until the wheels start to slip again, repeating steps 3 through
                    6. The following paragraphs describe the various modes in more detail.

                . The ECU is armed when the driver applies the brakes and sends a signal to the module to prepare for a
                possible antilock stop. Isolation will occur when the driver applies excessive braking for the given
                road conditions, causing the wheel(s) to decelerate at a rate greater than the vehicle is capable of. If
                the information from the wheel speed sensors indicates excessive wheel deceleration (imminent lock-up),
                the first step in the antilock sequence is to isolate the brake pressure being applied by the driver.
                The ECU sends a voltage, to the coil, to energize and close the isolation valve by pulling down on the
                armature with a magnetic force. This will prevent any additional brake pressure from reaching the wheel.
                Though each channel can operate independently, once any front channel (brake) sees excessive
                deceleration, both front ISO valves are energized and closed. Thus, with the isolation valves closed,
                further unnecessary increases in brake pressure will be prohibited.

                . Once the pressure is isolated, the ECU analyzes the wheel speed. If the wheel speed does not recover
                to the vehicle speed, brake pressure must be reduced in order to get the wheels rolling again. This is
                accomplished by dumping a portion of the brake fluid pressure into a low pressure accumulator (LPA). The
                ECU energizes the dump valve coil(s) to open the dump valve, allowing fluid from the wheels to be dumped
                into the LPA. Very short activation pulses open and close the dump valve passageway to control this
                action. Brake pressure is lowered at the wheel and allows the affected wheel to roll again. The fluid
                from the wheels forces a spring back and is stored in the LPA at approximately 1034 kPa (150 PSI). A
                portion of the fluid also primes the pump so it can begin building re-apply pressure. The dump valves
                are opened independently to control the deceleration of the wheel.

                . The re-apply sequence is initiated to obtain optimum braking at each wheel. The isolation valve is
                momentarily pulsed to allow master cylinder and pump pressure to reach the brakes. This controlled
                pressure rise continues until the wheel is at optimum brake output or until the brake pressure is
                brought up to the master cylinder output pressure. If more pressure is required, more fluid is drawn
                from the master cylinder and applied to the brakes. The driver will feel pedal pulsations, or pedal
                drop. This is normal and expected when in the antilock mode. As fluid is re-applied to the wheels, they
                begin to slow down at an optimum rate. If they approach imminent lock up again, the module will isolate,
                dump, and re-apply. These control cycles (isolation, dump, and re-apply) occur in millisecond intervals,
                allowing several cycles to occur each second. It occurs much faster with more control than manually
                pumping the brake pedal.

            <title>Brake Release</title>
            <para>At the end of the antilock stop, when the driver releases the brake pedal, the motor will remain on
                for a short time to help drain any fluid left in the LPA. As the fluid drains back into the system, the
                spring force in the LPA pushes the piston to the home position. When the brake switch opens, the
                isolation valve is turned off and fluid may return through the isolation orifice.
