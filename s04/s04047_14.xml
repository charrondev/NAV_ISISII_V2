        <para>It is recommended that all disc brake pads be replaced at the same time since this will maintain balanced
            braking of the vehicle. If complete replacement is not desirable or necessary, be sure that all disc brake
            pads on one axle (both sides) are replaced at the same time.

        <specpara>
            <note>
                <para>When replacing disc brake pads, be sure to use the same lining material type on both axles. Mixing
                    lining types can result in unbalanced braking and pad wear.

        <para>Disc brake pads should not be replaced only because of visual erosion or pitting. This is a normal
            characteristic of semi-metallic pad lining material. Should erosion reduce the polished contact area to less
            then 80% of total surface area, replace pads.

        <para>Pads must be replaced if an examination of disc brake pads reveals excessive chipping, flaking or severe
