            <title>Master Cylinder and Reservoir</title>
            <para>The master cylinder is mounted to the engine side of the cowl directly in front of the driver (see
                <hotlnk xrefid="f0404805">FIGURE 5</hotlnk>
                and
                <hotlnk xrefid="f0404806">FIGURE 6</hotlnk>). It consists of a dual channel (primary and secondary)
                piston assembly, providing separate circuits for the front and rear brakes. The master cylinder also
                contains the spring pack that returns the brake pedal to its up position, and provides the correct pedal
                'feel' to the driver. The purpose of the master cylinder is to translate the pedal force applied by the
                driver into the hydraulic pilot signals that are routed to the relay valve, attached to the hydraulic
                compact unit. The switch that detects a brake actuation (brake light switch) is mounted to the master
                cylinder and is replaceable without draining any brake fluid.
            </para>
            <para>The reservoir mounted to the top of the master cylinder provides the fill port for the entire brake
                system. This is accomplished by a low pressure hose that connects the master cylinder reservoir to the
                reservoir on top of the HCU. Internal baffles in the reservoir provide a protected volume of brake fluid
                for the master cylinder circuit, in the event of a leak in the remainder of the system. An external
                sensor mounted to the bottom of the reservoir detects when the brake fluid level is low. This sensor is
                replaceable without draining any brake fluid.

            <title>Hydraulic Compact Unit (HCU)</title>
            <para>The HCU is mounted to the inside of the left frame rail, behind the driver's position, and is the
                heart of the Full Power Brakes system (see
                <hotlnk xrefid="f0404807">FIGURE 7</hotlnk>
                and
                <hotlnk xrefid="f0404808">FIGURE 8</hotlnk>). The HCU responds to hydraulic inputs from the master
                cylinder. The ECU is mounted to the HCU, but will be described in more detail separately. Like the
                master cylinder, the HCU is divided into front and rear hydraulic channels. However, the electronically
                controlled ABS valves of the HCU allow independent control of the braking force at each of the four
                wheel ends during an ABS event.
            </para>
            <para>A port on the HCU provides the route for brake fluid to and from the Spring Apply Hydraulic Release
                (SAHR) parking brake canister. This port is controlled by the Pressure Supply Valve (PSV) which is
                mounted on the rear of the HCU. The ECU controls the PSV.
            </para>
            <para>It is worth noting that the accumulator, pump motor, and relay valve connection located to the rear of
                the HCU are part of the front axle brake circuit (see
                <hotlnk xrefid="f0404875">FIGURE 9</hotlnk>). Likewise, the rear half of the reservoir is also part of
                the front axle circuit. The components located to the front of the HCU are part of the rear axle
                circuit. However, the brake tubes feeding the front axle circuits are connected to the front of the HCU;
                and the rear axle circuits are fed by tubes connected to the rear of the HCU.

            <para>The wheel speed sensors are magnetic coil/pickup type sensors located at each wheel end (see

                and
                <hotlnk xrefid="f0404813">FIGURE 14</hotlnk>). Each sensor is positioned near a tooth ring (also known
                as a tone ring or exciter ring) which is attached to the wheel hub (see
                <hotlnk xrefid="f0404814">FIGURE 15</hotlnk>). As the wheel spins, the teeth (and the spaces between
                them) pass through the magnetic field of the sensor, causing the sensor to produce voltage pulses. The
                voltage pulses (signal) from each wheel speed sensor are routed to the ECU to indicate the relative
                speed of each wheel. The frequency of the wheel speed signal is directly proportional to the speed of
                the wheel. Broken or missing teeth, or corrosion between the teeth, can cause an inaccurate wheel speed
                signal.

                        is detected.) In this mode differential braking is used to control traction when one drive wheel
                        loses traction and vehicle speed is 31 mph or less. Engine torque limiting is used to control
                        traction when both drive wheels lose traction. This is the normal operating mode and should be
                        used for most driving conditions.
