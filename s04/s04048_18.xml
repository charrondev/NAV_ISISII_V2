            <para>The parking brake system employs a cable actuated, drum-style, driveline parking brake (see
                <hotlnk xrefid="f0404830">FIGURE 30</hotlnk>). When tension is applied to the brake cable, brake shoes
                are expanded inside of the drum, effectively locking the drive wheels. When tension is removed from the
                brake cable, springs retract the brake shoes, releasing the drum and unlocking the drive wheels. Refer

            <para>The parking brake dash switch has three switch states (positions): apply (out), neutral (center), and
                release (in). The switch is spring-loaded to return to the neutral (center) position after either of the
                other positions is selected. A resistor network in the switch assembly allows the ECU to detect the
                position of the switch by sensing a change in the resistance value of the switch circuit. The resistor
                network also allows the ECU to detect malfunctions in the switch circuit.
            </para>
            <para>When the ECU detects the switch 'apply' actuation, it sets both the PSV and the cut-off valve to their
                non-energized states. When non-energized, the cut-off valve is normally open, and the PSV connects the
                SAHR brake line to the HCU reservoir (see
                <hotlnk xrefid="f0404876">FIGURE 33</hotlnk>). This condition provides an open brake fluid connection
                between the SAHR canister and the HCU reservoir. With no pressurized fluid at the SAHR canister, the
                internal springs are used to retract the SAHR shaft, applying tension to the brake cable; which, in
                turn, applies the parking brake. The travel switch on the SAHR canister is used to indicate the shaft
                position to the ECU. If the shaft position does not indicate a properly applied parking brake, the ECU
                will generate a fault code and turn on the SERVICE PARK BRAKE indicator.

            <para>When the parking brake is released using the dash switch, the ECU electronically controls the PSV and
                the cut-off valve as follows. First, the PSV is energized to route brake fluid from the pressurized
                primary accumulator circuit to the SAHR canister. The cut-off valve remains non-energized (open) long
                enough for the pressurized brake fluid to overcome the force of the internal springs and extend the SAHR
                shaft (see
                <hotlnk xrefid="f0404877">FIGURE 34</hotlnk>). Once the travel switch indicates that the shaft has
                extended, the ECU energizes (closes) the cut-off valve, preventing the pressurized brake fluid from
                leaving the SAHR canister. After a short delay the ECU returns the PSV to its non-energized state so
                that the parking brake line is again open to the HCU reservoir. This allows the parking brake line to be
                unpressurized even though the SAHR canister is pressurized (park brake released). Refer to
                <hotlnk xrefid="f0404878">FIGURE 35</hotlnk>. With the SAHR shaft extended, the brake cable is no longer
                under tension and the parking brake is released. The travel switch on the SAHR canister is used to
                indicate the shaft position to the ECU. If the shaft position does not indicate a properly released
                parking brake, the ECU will generate a fault code and turn on the SERVICE PARK BRAKE indicator.

            <para>When the parking brake is in its released state (SAHR canister pressurized), small reductions of
                pressure may occur over a period of time. To prevent the pressure from dropping far enough to allow a
                partial parking brake application; the ECU commands the PSV and cut-off valve to repressurize the SAHR
                canister whenever the travel switch indicates that the SAHR shaft has moved beyond a preset limit. If
                system leakage requires the SAHR canister to be replenished too frequently, the HCU/ECU will enter the
                'backup mode' and generate a fault code. The 'backup mode' is described in the following paragraph. In
                this condition the HCU/ECU will also turn on the SERVICE PARK BRAKE indicator.
            </para>
            <para>The system has a safety function (backup mode) to ensure that the parking brake will not apply
                unexpectedly if the cut-off valve fails. When the cut-off valve fails it assumes its 'normally open'
                state. When the ECU detects a cut-off valve failure, it uses the PSV as a backup. To provide
                pressurization of the SAHR canister (to keep the park brake released), the ECU energizes the PSV. The
                energized PSV routes pressurized brake fluid from the primary accumulator circuit to the SAHR canister
                continuously to keep the parking brake in its 'released' state (see
                <hotlnk xrefid="f0404879">FIGURE 36</hotlnk>). The parking brake line is pressurized continuously during
                the backup mode. When the ECU detects the cut-off valve malfunction, it will generate a fault code and
                turn on the SERVICE PARK BRAKE indicator. The parking brake circuit is placed in the backup mode any
                time SERVICE PARK BRAKE indicator is turned on.
