            <para>To provide a means of comparison, the following paragraphs will describe the brake system without
                brakes applied and with brakes applied. NOTE: Parking brake operation will be described separately.

                shows the hydraulic system while in the Normal mode, without brakes applied. The system is divided into
                two channels: the primary channel (controls front axle) and the secondary channel (controls rear axle).
                The motor driven pumps maintain pressure in the accumulators where it is stored to provide braking
                energy. The pressure in each accumulator is maintained between 1770 psi and 2320 psi.
            </para>
            <para>When the ignition key is set to ON the brake system indicator lights in the gauge cluster perform a
                bulb check. Each indicator turns on for approximately 3 seconds, then turns off. (NOTE: The PARK BRAKE
                indicator will stay on until the parking brake is released.) The ECU monitors the pressure of the
                accumulators. If either accumulator is below its cut-in pressure, the ECU applies power to the correct
                pump motor circuit to pressurize the accumulator until the cut-out pressure is reached. The ECU monitors
                the status of the brake light switch in the master cylinder to determine if the brakes have been
                applied. The brake light switch is a diagnosable switch that allows the ECU to determine if the switch
                circuit is malfunctioning. The ECU also monitors conditions throughout the brake system to verify that
                no faults are present.
            </para>
            <para>In the event of a brake system malfunction, a warning lamp will illuminate and diagnostic codes
                identifying the source of the malfunction will be stored in the ECU memory. Retrieval of the diagnostic
                codes is explained in Section 5,

            <para>Without the brakes applied all of the solenoid valves are in their non-energized state. The only
                pressurized brake fluid is between the pump outlets and the relay valves. The state of the relay valves
                blocks the pressurized brake fluid from the rest of the system.

            <title>Normal Operation (Brakes Applied)</title>
            <para>The ECU monitors the status of the Master Cylinder (MC) brake light switch to determine when the
                brakes have been applied. Depressing the brake pedal causes the brake light switch to send a signal to
                the ECU. The ECU responds by sending two signals to the ESC. A hardwired signal and a J1939 data link
                signal are sent. If either signal, or both signals, are received by the ESC; the brake lights are turned
                on. If only one of the signals is received by the ESC, a fault is logged.

            <para>In the hydraulic system, when the brake pedal is pressed, two 'pilot signals' are sent from the master
                cylinder to the HCU relay valve. These two hydraulic lines are dead-headed at the HCU relay valve. The
                fluid in these lines applies pressure to the relay valves but does not flow into the HCU. In response to
                the pilot signals the relay valves route pressurized brake fluid from the accumulators, through the
                'normally open' inlet valves, to the brake calipers at the wheel ends. The relay valves are designed to
                apply braking pressure to the wheel end calipers in proportion to the strength of the MC pilot signals.
                <hotlnk xrefid="f0404824">Figure 24</hotlnk>
                shows the hydraulic system with brakes applied in the Normal mode. When the brake pedal is released, the
                relay valve closes and the pressurized brake fluid in the accumulators is blocked. The pressurized brake
                fluid in the calipers is allowed to return to the HCU reservoir through the open inlet valve and the
                open portion of the relay valve.
