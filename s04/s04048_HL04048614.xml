            <para>The manifold/cartridge assembly comprises the active hydraulic components located inside of the SAHR
                canister. A malfunction requiring replacement of this component may cause brake fluid to leak into the
                SAHR canister, therefore removal of the canister is recommended prior to removing this component. The
                manifold/cartridge can then be replaced on the bench. Refer to

                        While performing the next 2 steps assume that fluid is present in the canister body, and be
                        prepared to prevent leakage.
