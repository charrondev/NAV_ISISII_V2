                        on the Master Cylinder (MC) reservoir. The MC reservoir should be regularly checked and filled
                        to the MAX mark with new DOT 3 or DOT 4 brake fluid. Failure to keep the brake reservoir level
                        above the MIN mark could result in more air entering the system, making it impossible to
                        effectively bleed the system.

                        the ABS outlet valves for the rear accumulator are opened allowing fluid from the accumulator to
                        flow out of the outlet valves to the reservoir. While the motor/pump attempts to maintain
                        accumulator pressure by pumping more fluid into the accumulator, the pressure actually decreases
                        due to the open relay valve and outlet valves. The rapid flow of fluid clears any air bubbles
                        from the HCU. After a predetermined period of time, the outlet valves are closed allowing the
                        rear accumulator to build pressure to its shutoff value, which turns off the motor/pump. The
                        front accumulator circuit performs the same operation, but is slightly delayed from the rear
                        circuit. The front accumulator will complete the cycle about 12 seconds after the rear
                        accumulator. The changes in the accumulator pressures can be observed on the TOOLBOX diagnostic
                        screen. When accumulator pressures have been re-established, a dialog box will be displayed
                        indicating that the function has been completed.
