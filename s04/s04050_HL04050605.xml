                    <para>The design and composition of the low pressure hose is critical. The low pressure hose must be
                        replaced with the same design as installed by the manufacturer. The use of an incompatible hose
                        assembly may cause system damage and loss of braking. Failure to follow this warning could
                        result in property damage, personal injury or death.

                        the dealer, and components are to be replaced, the prescribed procedure must be followed
