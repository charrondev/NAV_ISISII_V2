                        service is to be performed on the brake system, depressurizing the system may be necessary to
                        prevent injury. Check the procedures for the specific service being performed. Failure to follow
                        this warning could result in property damage, personal injury or death.

                    <para>This is a modern, complex system offering greater braking proficiency and features than

                        replaced, users are strongly advised to contact the nearest International dealer for
                        professional assistance and repair. However, if location and circumstances prevent consulting
                        the dealer, and components are to be replaced, the prescribed procedure must be followed
                        accurately.

                        Electrostatic Discharge (ESD). Damaged circuitry would prevent the ECU from operating correctly
                        in the ABS and/or ATC modes.
