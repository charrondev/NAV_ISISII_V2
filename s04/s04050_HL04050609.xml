                    <para>Any form of contamination entering the system could prevent the system from operating
                        correctly. Thoroughly clean the area around fittings before disconnecting the fittings. Always
                        plug open ports and lines as quickly as possible. Contamination in the system could result in
                        loss of braking functions during vehicle operation. Failure to follow this warning could result
                        in property damage, personal injury or death.

                    <para>Individuals without factory training are advised not to work on the Full Power Brakes system

                    <para>This is a modern, complex system offering greater braking proficiency and features than
                        previous systems. If the system sustains damage or a component malfunctions and items need to be
                        replaced, users are strongly advised to contact the nearest International dealer for
                        professional assistance and repair. However, if location and circumstances prevent consulting
                        the dealer, and components are to be replaced, the prescribed procedure must be followed
                        accurately.

                    <para>Precharged HCU's and spare parts must be handled with the appropriate care and attention and

                        ports prior to assembly to the vehicle.

            <para>Access to the HCU reservoir depends on the body installed on the vehicle; therefore, removal of the
                entire HCU (with reservoir) is required prior to replacement of the reservoir. The reservoir can then be
                replaced on the bench.
