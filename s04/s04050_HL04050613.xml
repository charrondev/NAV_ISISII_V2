                        Jacks can slip and fall over. Failure to follow this warning could result in property damage,
                        personal injury or death.

                        replaced, users are strongly advised to contact the nearest International dealer for
                        professional assistance and repair. However, if location and circumstances prevent consulting
                        the dealer, and components are to be replaced, the prescribed procedure must be followed
                        accurately.
