                for Items in parentheses.

            <para>The actuating shaft (Item 1) is connected to the steering column and is centered within the rotary
                valve by a torsion bar. The rotary valve shaft is threaded into the piston with ball threads (Item 2)
                and travels within the piston on steel balls. Circular motion on the actuating shaft causes high
                pressure fluid to build up on one end of the piston. This higher pressure causes the piston to move in
                the bore of the gear housing. The sector shaft (Item 3) is engaged to a rack gear (Item 4) machined into
                one side of the piston. Piston rack movement causes sector shaft and pitman arm rotation. When steering
                shaft rotation stops, the actuating valve returns to its neutral position. Relief valve plungers or
                adjustable stops are used in the bearing cap and cylinder head. When the plungers are adjusted properly,
                they will unload the hydraulic system if the wheels are in a full turn to either direction.

            <para>When the engine is running, there is constant low pressure oil flow through the steering gear. This
                constant oil flow provides an instant response and absorbs road shock to help eliminate steering wheel
                kick. Pressure is equal throughout the steering gear. However, care should be used in towing or moving a
                vehicle where the engine or hydraulic supply pump is not running.

                        mechanical back-up steering so that the vehicle may be safely steered to the side of the road.
