        <para>Pressure to operate the secondary or slave gear is passed through ports in either the cylinder head,
            sector shaft bore or bearing cap of the master gear. It is routed through high pressure lines to the proper
            end of the slave gear. When the actuating shaft of the master gear is moved, it causes a pressure build up
            on the piston of the master gear. This same pressure is directed to the opposite end of the slave gear
            piston (

            illustrates a typical dual M-Series steering gear layout. Fluid from the slave gear is returned to the
            master gear and back to the reservoir. The lines between the master gear and slave gear act as both pressure
            and return lines.

            <hotlnk xrefid="f05002a4">Figure 104</hotlnk>
            illustrates an M-Series master gear and an older style M-292, M-392, or M-492 Series slave gear used in a
            dual steering gear installation. Fluid from the master gear is routed through the pinion gear area of the
            slave gear and then to the reservoir. This system requires the use of more hoses than the dual M-Series
            system.

                    Failure to bleed the steering system could result in an accident, injury or death.
