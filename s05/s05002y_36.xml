            <para>The M-Series models use a seal ring on one end of the power piston. A new seal is installed by placing
                the back-up O-ring in the piston groove and installing the teflon seal ring over it.

                        with the seal rings in place, it will become easier to install it in the piston bore. Use of a
                        ring compressor is best to limit damage to the piston ring (
