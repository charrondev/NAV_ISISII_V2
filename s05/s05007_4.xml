        <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
        <para>The LUK power steering pumps are used primarily to supply a flow of hydraulic fluid for operation of power
            steering mechanisms. Pumps in this series are of the balanced vane type and have a constant rate of delivery
            per revolution. Direction of pump shaft rotation and pumping capacity may be changed to suit specific
            applications. Major differences include: types of reservoirs, manifolds, pump mountings and drive shaft
            configurations which are found in the model code breakdowns in

        <para>Principal components (
            <hotlnk xrefid="f0500703">Figure 3</hotlnk>) of the pump consist of the body, flange, cam ring, rotor,
            vanes, pressure plate, wear plate, control valve and drive shaft subassembly. These pumps are designed for
            indirect drive; however, special engineering application must be obtained for gear drive operation when
            small diameter gears or extreme helix gears are used.

        <para>The pumps are equipped with integral cartridge type flow control relief valves. At a volume greater than
            the rated flow, excess flow is bypassed to the inlet within the pump by the flow control valve. The flow
            control valve operates on pressure differential. The relief valve also operates on a pressure differential
            and limits the maximum pressure in the hydraulic circuit.
