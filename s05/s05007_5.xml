            <para>The rotor is driven within the cam ring by the drive shaft, which is coupled to the power source. As
                the rotor spins, centrifugal force on the vanes causes them to follow the elliptical inner surface of
                the cam ring.
            </para>
            <para>Radial movement of the vanes and turning of the rotor cause the chamber volume between the vanes to
                increase as the vanes pass the inlet sections of the cam ring. This results in a low pressure condition
                which allows atmospheric pressure to force fluid into the chambers. (Fluid outside the inlet is at
                atmospheric pressure or higher.)
            </para>
            <para>This fluid is trapped between the vanes and carried past the large diameter or dwell section of the
                cam ring. As the outlet section is approached, the cam ring diameter decreases (more pressure is applied
                to the fluid) and the fluid is forced out into the system.
            </para>
            <para>System pressure is fed under the vanes, assuring their sealing contact against the ring during normal
                operation.
