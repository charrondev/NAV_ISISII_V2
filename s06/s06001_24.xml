        <svcprocinfo>
            <para>Vibration that is felt during vehicle operation will generally fall in one or more categories. Not all
                vibrations are caused by the propeller shaft assembly.
            </para>
            <para>First you must determine the source of the problem. To assist in finding the source, you must
                interview the operator to determine what, where and when the vibration is encountered.
            </para>
            <para>Next, road test the vehicle with and without typical loads while recording engine RPM and road speed
                of disturbance in all transmission and rear axle ranges. If the problem is prevalent when pulling a
                trailer, it will be necessary to road test with a different trailer and load to assist in defining the
                cause of the disturbance.

            <para>Transverse vibration is the result of a bending movement caused by improper balance (

            <para>A universal joint has a maximum angle at which it will transmit power smoothly.</para>
            <para>Torsional vibration is a twisting motion most commonly caused by unequal universal joint working
                angles (

            </figure>
            <para>When two shafts connected together by a universal joint are operated at an angle, the driven shaft
                speed will change in relation to the driving shaft speed. Twice during rotation, the driven shaft speed
                will increase and decrease compared to the driving shaft speed. This speed fluctuation creates torsional
                excitation (winding up and unwinding) of the propeller shaft.
            </para>
            <para>With equal working angles, the rear of the shaft will slow down by the same amount that the front
                speeds up. This results in a propeller shaft that turns at a constant speed without twisting.
            </para>
            <para>Torsional vibration is harder to identify during road testing, but it has certain characteristics:

                    <para>Torsional vibrations can exist at one or more speeds and usually is more severe at low

                    <para>Torque and load changes will affect the vibration. Normally the vibration will be affected
                        directly by a change in throttle position. Load, as in with or without a trailer, also affects
                        this kind of vibration.
