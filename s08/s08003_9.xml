        <title>THROTTLE POSITION SENSOR (TPS)</title>
        <para>The throttle position sensor (TPS) is located on the transmission. The sensor consists of a pull actuation
            cable and a potentiometer (
            <hotlnk xrefid="f0800306">Figure 6</hotlnk>). The cable is attached to the potentiometer inside a protective
            housing. The other end attaches to the engine fuel lever. Allison installs the TPS and cable and
            International connects the cable end to the fuel lever and connects the transmission harness to the TPS.

        </figure>
        <para>The purpose of the TPS is to signal the power level of the engine to the transmission. Throttle lever
            movement is transformed into an output voltage signal from the TPS, through the transmission harness to the
            ECU. This signal is used to determine the timing of shifts by the ECU.
        </para>
        <para>The TPS has a self-adjusting feature. Each time the vehicle key switch is turned ON, the ECU incorporates
            a "self-adjusting" feature which will compensate for changes such as normal wear and linkage tolerances.
