        <title>TROUBLESHOOTING WITH DIAGNOSTIC CODES</title>
        <svcprocinfo>
            <para>The tests in this section are written to be performed by reading the diagnostic codes using the shift
                selector and the Fluke 23 multimeter. In many cases a Pro-Link 9000 can be used for reading the codes
                and performing some system diagnostics if the proper Allison cartridge is available. Note that if
                battery power is not present at the VIM, the Pro-Link will not be able to read the codes or perform
                other diagnostics.
            </para>
            <para>When beginning the troubleshooting process, always check for ACTIVE diagnostic codes first.
                <emph type="bold">The codes listed in this service section are only those codes that are likely to be
                    involved with International-installed components and harnesses.</emph>For a full listing of
                diagnostic codes, refer to the Allison WT Service Manual.

            <title>Main Code 13 Sub Code 12 or 23 - ECU Input Voltage</title>
            <para>This code means the ECU has detected either a high or low battery input voltage. The ECU monitors
                battery voltage levels at the ignition feed circuit connection to the ECU (circuit 146 at B12), not the
                battery feed circuit. LOW voltage is considered less than 8 volts, and HIGH voltage is considered more
                than 32 volts. Common causes for this code are usually vehicle wiring conditions, vehicle charging
                system and batteries, or poor ground conditions.
