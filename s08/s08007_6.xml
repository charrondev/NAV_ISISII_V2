            <para>The purpose of the this switch is to reverse the polarity of the feed and ground circuits to the
                temperature control potentiometer. This is done so that the temperature control knob moved clockwise
                (turned into red area) will indicate a call for more heat (winter position), or less air conditioning
                (summer position). If the knob is turned counter-clockwise, it indicates a call for less heat (winter
                position), or more cooling (summer position).
