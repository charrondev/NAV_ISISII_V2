            </para>
            <para>The Auto Temperature Control Module (ATCM) is the brain of the thermostat control system. The ATCM is
                powered by 12 volts (key ON or ACC) from the auxiliary bunk blower relay (147), on circuit 75AH at
                connector (598). The ATCM is grounded through circuit 75-GS at cab ground adapter (454).
            </para>
            <para>The ATCM receives inputs from the blower sensor, aspirator sensor and temperature control
                potentiometer. The ATCM processes the inputs and outputs a signal to the Flat Pack that controls the
                position of the blower damper door.

            </para>
            <para>The blower sensor (a thermistor) is located in the sleeper blower motor housing. The Auto Temperature
                Control Module (ATCM) applies a regulated five volts to the thermistor, which is grounded back to the
                ATCM. The thermistor changes resistance as the temperature changes. (As the temperature goes down,
                resistance goes up.) The change in resistance creates the signal for the ATCM.
            </para>
            <para>The ATCM uses the input from the blower sensor to determine if the the Blendaire is in the heating
                mode or air conditioning (A.C.) mode.
            </para>
            <para>If the blower sensor indicates cooler air temperatures than the aspirator sensor, the Blendaire unit
                is judged to be in the A.C. mode.
            </para>
            <para>If the blower sensor is warmer than the aspirator sensor, the Blendaire unit is judged to be in the
                heater mode.

            </para>
            <para>The Aspirator Sensor/Fan assembly is located on the top, backside of the control panel, with several
                small holes in the control panel to allow air flow through the panel. The Aspirator fan draws air from
                the sleeper compartment through the control panel and across the Aspirator sensor (thermistor). The
                Aspirator fan is on whenever the key switch is ON (or ACC position). The fan receives 12 volt power (key
                ON or ACC) from the Auxiliary Bunk Blower Relay (147) on circuit 75AR. The fan is grounded through
                circuit 75-GAF to cab ground adapter (454).
            </para>
            <para>The Auto Temperature Control Module (ATCM) applies a five volt voltage to the aspirator sensor
                (thermistor), which is grounded back to the ATCM. The thermistor changes resistance as the temperature
                changes. (As the temperature goes down, resistance goes up.) The change in resistance creates the signal
                for the ATCM. The Aspirator sensor input to the ATCM enables the ATCM to determine ambient sleeper
                compartment temperature.

            </para>
            <para>The Temperature Control switch (potentiometer) is used by the sleeper compartment occupant to request
                a warmer or cooler setting for the sleeper compartment. The ATCM knows the ambient temperature of the
                sleeper (Aspirator Sensor) and knows if the the Blendaire unit is set for heating or air conditioning
                (compares blower sensor temperature to Aspirator sensor temperature).
            </para>
            <para>The temperature control switch receives a five volt input at connector (592) terminal A on circuit
                75AM. The input is from the auto temperature control module connector (598) terminal D. Temperature
                control switch terminal C is grounded by circuit 75AN to auto temperature control module connector (598)
                terminal E.
            </para>
            <para>Temperature Control switch outputs a variable signal from terminal B on circuit 75AL to ACTM connector
                (598) at terminal C. The signal indicates the desired temperature setting (center setting is
                approximately 75&#176;F). The ACTM compares the Temperature control setting to the ambient temperature,
                and opens or closes the damper door to adjust the amount of heated (or cooled) air to the sleeper.

            <para>The flat pack is bolted to the blower motor housing, and controls the blower motor damper door
                position. Circuit 75AP delivers battery voltage (key ON) to the Flat Pack from the Auxiliary Blower
                relay (147). The Flat Pack is grounded through circuit 75-GK at cab ground adapter (454). The Flat Pack
                receives a variable "door position" signal on circuit 75AS from the ATCM connector (598) terminal H.
