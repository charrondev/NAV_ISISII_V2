                    <hotlnk xrefid="f0801009">Figure 9</hotlnk>) works properly with the jumper wire in place, but does
                    not work when the jumper wire is removed, the circuit has an open spot.

            <para>Jumper wires are fitted with several types of tips or ends. It will be helpful to have several jumper
                wires available with different tips.

            <para>If bypassing the switch with a jumper wire causes the light to illuminate, but closing the switch does
                not, it indicates the switch has failed.
            </para>
            <para>If, when the switch is closed, the light does not illuminate, and "jumpering" the switch doesn't cause
                the light to operate, but "jumpering" the light to ground causes the light to operate, then there is an
                open in the ground circuit.

            <para>The jumper wire can be used to check for open relay contacts, wire breaks, poor ground connections,
                etc.

            <para>NEVER insert the test meter probe tip into connectors where the probe tip will expand the terminal.
                Expanded terminals will cause increased circuit resistance.

            <para>Construct test leads using a mating terminal, a short lead and an alligator clip. Insert the mating
                terminal into the connector and attach the alligator clip to the meter lead.
