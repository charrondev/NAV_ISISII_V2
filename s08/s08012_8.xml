                <para>Ohmmeter checks for opens can be made only on "Y" stators, visually identified by three stator
                    leads crimped together. Delta windings cannot be checked for opens with an ohmmeter . Usually
                    laboratory equipment is required to check Delta windings.

        </specpara>
        <para>A short circuit in the stator windings is difficult to locate without laboratory test equipment due to the
            low resistance of the windings. However, if all other electrical checks are normal and the alternator fails
            to supply rated output, a shorted stator winding or an open Delta winding is indicated. Check the voltage
            regulator before replacing stator.
