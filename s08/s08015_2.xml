        <para>The base emitter of transistors TR3 and TR1 is connected to the battery through resistor R5, thus turning
            these transistors on. Also, resistors R2 and R3 are connected to the battery through the voltage adjustment
            on models so equipped, but the discharge current of the battery is very low because of the resistance values
            of R2, R3, R5, TR1 and TR3.
        </para>
        <para>With the generator operating, A.C. voltages initially are generated in the stator windings by residual
            magnetism in the rotor. The diodes in the rectifier bridge change the stator A.C. voltages to a D.C. voltage
            which appears between ground and the "BAT" terminal. As speed increases, current is provided for charging
            the battery and operating electrical accessories.
        </para>
        <para>The stator also supplies D.C. field current through the diode trio, the field, TR1, and then through the
            diodes in the rectifier bridge back to the stator.
        </para>
        <para>As the speed and voltage increase, the voltage between R2 and R3 increases to the value where zener diode
            D1 conducts. Transistor TR2 then turns on and TR1 and TR3 turn off. With TR1 off, the field current and
            system voltage decrease and D1 then blocks current flow causing TR1 and TR2 to turn back on. The field
            current and system voltage increase and this cycle then repeats many times per second to limit the voltage
            to the adjusted value.
        </para>
        <para>If the voltage adjustment cube (where used) should become an open circuit, TR3 and TR1 will turn off
            preventing high system voltage.
        </para>
        <para>Capacitor C1 smooths out the voltage across R3, resistor R4 prevents excessive current through TR1 at high
            temperatures, and diode D2 prevents high-induced-voltages in the field windings when TR1 turns off.
