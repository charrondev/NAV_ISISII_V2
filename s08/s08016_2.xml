            <para>The base-emitter of transistors TR3 amd TR1 is connected to the battery through resistor R5, thus
                turning these transistors on. Also, resistors R2 and R3 are connected to the battery through the voltage
                adjustment, where equipped, but the discharge current of the battery is very low because of the
                resistance values of R2, R3, R5, TR1 and TR3.
            </para>
            <para>With the alternator operating, AC voltages initially are generated in the stator windings by residual
                magnetism in the rotor. The diodes in the rectifier bridge change the stator AC voltages to a DC voltage
                which appears between ground and the "BAT" terminals. As speed increases, current is provided for
                charging the battery and operating electrical accessories.
            </para>
            <para>The stator also supplies DC field current through the diode trio, the field, TR1 and then through the
                diodes in the rectifier bridge back to the stator.
            </para>
            <para>As the speed and voltage increase, the voltage between R2 and R3 increases to the value where zener
                diode D1 conducts. Transistor TR2 then turns on and Tr1 and TR3 turn off. With TR1 off, the field
                current and system voltage decrease and D1 then blocks current flow causing TR1 and TR3 to turn back on.
                The field current and system voltage increase and this cycle then repeats many times per second to limit
                the voltage to the adjusted value.
            </para>
            <para>If the voltage adjustment, where used, should become open-circuit, TR3 and TR1 will turn off, thus
                preventing high system voltage.
            </para>
            <para>Capacitor C1 smooths out the voltage across R3, resistor R4 prevents excessive current through TR1 at
                high temperatures, and diode D2 prevents high-induced voltages in the field windings when TR1 turns off.
