                <para>If both readings are the same, replace the rectifier bridge by detaching the necessary screws and
                    nuts. A good rectifier bridge will give one high and one low reading. Repeat this same test between
                    the same heat sink and the other two terminals, and between the other heat sink and each of the
                    three terminals. This makes a total of six checks, with two readings taken for each check. If
                    rectifier bridge is constructed with flat metal clips at the three studs, press down very firmly
                    onto flat metal clips and not onto threaded stud.
