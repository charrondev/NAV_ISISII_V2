            <para>As in other systems, the regulator limits the system voltage by controlling the rotor field current.
                The regulator switches the field current on and off at a fixed frequency of about 400 cycles per second.
                By varying the on-off time, the correct average field current for proper system voltage control is
                obtained. At high speeds, the on-time may be 10%, and the off-time 90%. At low speeds with high
                electrical loads, the on-time and off-time may be 90% and 10% respectively.

            <para>The Packard type connector on the alternator (
                <hotlnk xrefid="f0801904"></hotlnk>) has four terminals identified as "S," "I," "L" and "P." The use of
                the "P," "L," and "S" terminals is optional (
                <hotlnk document="s08019_1.xml" xrefid="f0801901">Figure 1</hotlnk>). CS Series alternators require the
                "L" or "I" terminal wired to the chassis. The additional terminals allow other electrical devices to be
                connected to the alternator for a variety of purposes. The "S" terminal (
                <hotlnk xrefid="f0801904">Figure 4</hotlnk>) may be connected to an external voltage source, such as the
                battery, to sense the voltage being regulated. The "L" terminal supplies voltage for the field (
                <hotlnk xrefid="f0801904">Figure 4</hotlnk>). The "P" terminal is wired to the stator and may be used to
                drive a tachometer or other rpm sensing device (
                <hotlnk xrefid="f0801904">Figure 4</hotlnk>). The "I" terminal alone, or both the "I" and "L" terminals
                can supply voltage for the field (
                <hotlnk xrefid="f0801904">Figure 4</hotlnk>). The "I" terminal can be connected to the ignition switch
                either directly or through a resistance wire.
