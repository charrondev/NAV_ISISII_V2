        <title>STATOR TEST</title>
        <para>Use a Wheatstone Bridge or an ohmmeter capable of measuring 1/1000 ohm to check stator for grounds and for
            phase resistance. Stator is OK when no circuit is present between lamination and each of the three leads,
            and resistance readings across each phase are approximately the same. It is suggested that stators be "high
            pot" tested by a qualified electrical shop to help identify borderline stators.

            <warning>
                <para>The "high pot" test can cause severe injury or death. This test is restricted to qualified
                    personnel only.
