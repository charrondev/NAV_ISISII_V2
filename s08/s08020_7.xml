        <title>DIODE TESTS</title>
        <svcprocinfo>
            <para>These tests may be performed on heat sink assemblies without removing them from the end housing. If
                they are tested in this manner, remove the stator and be sure that the red and black leads are
                disconnected from the regulator and not touching each other. Disconnect the capacitor across the lower
                end of the heat sinks.
            </para>
            <para>Diodes are tested to insure that they only pass current in one direction. Diodes which do not allow
                current to flow in either direction are open while diodes passing current both ways are shorted. Diodes
                should be checked with a diode tester, but in emergencies where one is not available, an ohmmeter or a
                battery powered test light may be substituted.

            <title>Positive Heat Sink Tests</title>
            <para>The positive heat sink is the one to which the positive output terminal is connected. The square hole
                in the terminal end of the positive heat sink is larger than the terminal hole of the negative heat
                sink.

                    heat sink and touch the negative test lead to each of the three diode terminals (Test 1,

                    light is being used, it should not light. If any of the three diodes shows a low resistance, or the
                    test lamp lights, the diode is shorted. Refer to the following

                        <para>When making diode tests, some ohmmeters may indicate results opposite of those shown in
                            text (i.e., a high resistance when text calls for low resistance, etc.). Regardless of this,
                            each diode should give one high reading and one low reading. If both readings are the same,
                            diode is faulty.

                    obtain the maximum serviceability, several different assemblies may be used as replacements. These
                    will be listed in the appropriate parts list.
