        <svcprocinfo>
            <para>Visually inspect the outside of the battery for obvious damage such as cracked or broken case or cover
                which would allow electrolyte loss. Check for terminal damage. If obvious physical damage is found,
                replace the battery. If possible, determine the cause of damage and correct.

            <title>Filler Cap and Semi-Maintenance Free Batteries</title>
            <para>Remove the cell caps and check electrolyte level. On some batteries, a knife blade is used to cut
                through the top plaque center section on the dotted lines to gain access to the cell caps (
                <hotlnk xrefid="f0802204">Figure 4</hotlnk>). After removal of the section of the plaque, individual
                caps can be unscrewed to allow access to each cell. When reinstalling cell caps after testing, make sure
                caps are properly seated.

                amperes to mix the water with the electrolyte.

                is not to be used to determine if battery is good or bad. The test indicator is a built-in hydrometer in
                one cell and provides visual information for battery testing.
