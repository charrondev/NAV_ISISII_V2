            <note>
                <para>To perform TEST 1 or 2 with Caterpillar 3406B engine with PEEC and Kysor engine shutdown, the
                    power to the speedometer/tachometer unit comes through the Run Relay when the run relay is activated
                    by starting the engine. To perform TEST 1 or 2, which require "key switch ON" in this section
                    without running the engine, install a jumper wire connecting the number 1 and number 3 terminals of
                    the Kysor control module. BE SURE TO REMOVE THE JUMPER BEFORE STARTING THE ENGINE.

        <para>This test should be run when NEITHER the speedometer or tachometer pointer moves (dead) during TEST 1. The
            speedometer, tachometer and odometer rely on a single B+ voltage source and a single ground circuit. If
            either is defective the speedometer/tachometer unit will not function.
