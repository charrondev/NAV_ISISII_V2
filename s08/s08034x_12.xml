                <para>At the assembly plant, all the DIP switches are set at 0, and the speedometer and tachometer are
                    programmed electronically. The speedometer and tachometer receive the proper setting, but the switch
                    levers remain on 0. Moving any of the DIP switches from the 0 position disables the speedometer and
                    tachometer programming.
                    <emph type="italic">If a DIP switch is moved for re-programming or any other reason, then all the
                        DIP switches must be moved to the positions indicated on the vehicle's line set ticket.

                    are returned to 0, the original factory programmed settings will be re-enabled.

        <para>There will be two (2) banks of DIP switches visible. Ten switches, the left bank of eight (8) switches and
            two (2) switches on the left end of the right bank, Item 4,
            <hotlnk xrefid="f0803410">Figure 10</hotlnk>
            , are required to manually program the speedometer. The number eight (8) switch on the right bank is for
            setting the odometer between English and metric readings, Item 8,
            <hotlnk xrefid="f0803410">Figure 10</hotlnk>
            . For miles per hour (MPH), the setting should be down (0). For a kilometers per hour (KPH) speedometer, the
            setting should be up (1).
        </para>
        <para>The third switch position (Item 5,
            <hotlnk xrefid="f0803410">Figure 10</hotlnk>) on the right DIP switch bank is for calibration of the two
            available two-speed axle ratios. These are 1.36:1 (switch in the 0 setting or down position) and 1.39:1
            (switch at the 1 setting or up position). If the vehicle does not have a two-speed axle, the switch is
            inactive.
