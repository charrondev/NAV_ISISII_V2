        <para>Grounds - If the motor has one or more coils normally connected to ground, the ground connections must be
            disconnected during this check. Connect one lead of to the field frame and the other lead to the field
            connector. If resistance is shown, at least one field coil is grounded and must be repaired or replaced.
            This check cannot be made if the ground connection cannot be disconnected.
        </para>
        <para>Opens - Connect the test lamp leads to ends of the field coils. If the lamp does not light, the field
            coils are open.
