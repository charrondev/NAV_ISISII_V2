        <title>TESTING HELLA RELAY</title>
        <para>International circuits use
            <emph type="bold">suppressed</emph>
            Hella relays (1672537C1) for controlling power to load devices (
            <hotlnk xrefid="f0813506">Figure 5.06</hotlnk>). The suppression feature (a resistor circuit parallel to the
            relay coil) prevents voltage spikes from damaging electronic components in the vehicle.
            <emph type="bold">These relays must be replaced with the correct International part</emph>.The part number
            is embossed on the relay. There is also a circuit diagram of the relay located on the relay body. The
            terminals are numbered on the relay in the same manner as in the circuit diagrams. To test the relay, use
            the following steps:
        </para>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">With the relay removed, measure the resistance between relay terminals 85 and 86 (coil
                resistance). The resistance should be approximately 26 ohms.
            </para>
            <step2>
                <para count="1">If the resistance is correct, go to step 2.</para>
            </step2>
            <step2>
                <para count="1">If the resistance is not correct, replace the relay.</para>
            </step2>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">Measure resistance between terminals 30 and 87a. The resistance should be less than 1.0
                ohm.

            </step2>
        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">Use 12V battery source and test leads and apply 12V across terminals 85 and 86. (The relay
                should make an audible click.) Use ohmmeter and measure resistance between terminals 30 and 87 with
                relay energized. Resistance should be 1.0 ohm or less.
