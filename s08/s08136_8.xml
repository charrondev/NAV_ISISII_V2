            <para>Refer to the Operator's Manual for operating instructions.</para>
            <para>Cruise Control operates when vehicle speed is greater than 35 mph and engine rpm is greater than 1200
                rpm. Note that the engine speed signal used by the ECM in controlling the cruise system comes from the
                DDEC sensors. The vehicle tachometer is driven by a International installed engine speed sensor.
            </para>
            <para>PTO controls will only operate when vehicle speed is zero and the vehicle park brake is set (causes
                the PTO Park Brake Switch (361) to open).

            <title>Cruise Control Brake/Clutch Relay (364)</title>
            <para>The cruise control brake/clutch relay is used to enable and disable the cruise or PTO controls and the
                engine brake (if equipped).
            </para>
            <para>Cruise Control - For the cruise control to operate, this relay must be energized. Depressing the
                clutch pedal, applying the service brakes or setting the park brake will cause the relay to de-energize,
                disabling the cruise control.
            </para>
            <para>PTO Controls - The PTO operates when vehicle speed is zero AND the Park Brake is set (opening the PTO
                Park Brake Switch). Releasing the park brake disables the PTO.

                    <para>The Cruise Control Brake/Clutch Relay is a suppressed relay to prevent voltage spikes from
                        entering the electrical system when the relay is de-energized. ONLY replace this relay with the
                        correct part. All relays in International systems are suppressed relays.

            <para>With the Cruise Control Brake/Clutch Relay energized, the signal from ECM terminal G2 passes through
                the relay (NO terminal 87 and common terminal 30) to the Cruise ON/OFF switch (357). Placing the ON/OFF
                switch in the ON position completes the circuit from G2 to ground, turning the cruise control system ON.

            <title>Cruise Control Brake/Clutch Relay (364) De-Energized</title>
            <para>To turn the PTO controls ON, this relay must be de-energized by applying the Park brake (PTO/Park
                Brake Switch (361) is open with park brake set) AND the ECM must see ZERO vehicle speed.

            <para>With relay (364) de-energized, the signal from ECM terminal J2 passes through the relay (NC contact
                87A and common contact 30) on circuit 97AG to the Cruise ON/OFF switch. Closing the switch completes the
                circuit from J2 to ground, turning the PTO controls ON.

            <para>The Clutch Switch is a normally OPEN switch, adjusted to be closed when the clutch pedal is in the
                released position. The Clutch Switch receives 12V ignition power from F2 10 amp fuse when the key switch
                is ON. The clutch switch is wired in series with the Service Brake Switch (369), the PTO Park Brake
                Switch (361) and the Cruise Control Brake/Clutch Relay (364) control coil.

                through the Clutch Switch (clutch pedal released). The ground circuit for the service brake switch is
                through the PTO Park Brake Switch (361) and the Cruise Control Brake/Clutch Relay (364) control coil.

                through the service brake switch (service brakes released) and the clutch switch (pedal released). With
                power to the park brake switch, releasing the park brake applies power to energize the Cruise Control
                Brake/Clutch Relay (364).

                position. When the Cruise Control Brake/Clutch Relay (364)
                <emph type="bold">is not energized,</emph>

                the Cruise control mode.
            </para>
            <para>When the cruise switch is in the ON position, the ground path from ECM terminal J2 or G2 is completed,

            <title>Momentary Cruise Control Selector Switch (358)</title>
            <para>The momentary cruise control selector switch receives signals on four circuits from the ECM. When the
                Cruise Control ON/OFF switch is in the ON position, the ground path for the four circuits is through the
                ON/OFF switch to the ECM power connector to ground at the negative battery terminal.

            <para>The vehicle speed sensor is a dual coil sensor with two leads (two wires in each lead). The speed
                sensor is located at the rear of the transmission. One speed sensor lead sends a variable AC signal
                through the engine harness (circuits 97AJ and 97AK) to ECM terminals E2 and E3. The other lead sends a
                variable AC signal through the chassis and cab harness to the speedometer/tachometer unit located in the
                instrument panel.
