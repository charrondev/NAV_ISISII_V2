            <emph type="bold">suppressed</emph>
            Hella relays (1672537C1) for controlling power to load devices (
            <hotlnk xrefid="f0814006">Figure 6</hotlnk>). The suppression feature (a resistor circuit parallel to the
            relay coil) prevents voltage spikes from damaging electronic components in the vehicle.
            <emph type="bold">These relays must be replaced with the correct International part</emph>. The part number
            is embossed on the relay. There is also a circuit diagram of the relay located on the relay body. The
            terminals are numbered on the relay in the same manner as in the circuit diagrams. To test the relay, use
            the following steps:
