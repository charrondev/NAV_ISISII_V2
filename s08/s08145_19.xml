            relay coil) prevents voltage spikes from damaging electronic components in the vehicle.

        <para>The part number is embossed on the relay. There is also a circuit diagram of the relay located on the
            relay body. The terminals are numbered on the relay in the same manner as in the circuit diagrams. To test
            the relay use the following steps:

        <step1>
            <para count="1">With the relay removed, measure resistance between relay coil terminals 85 and 86 (coil
                resistance). The resistance should be approximately 72 ohms.

                relay should make an audible click.) Use ohmmeter and measure resistance between the relay common
                terminal 30 and normally open terminal 87, while the relay is energized. Resistance should be 1.0 ohms
                or less.
