            <para>The "Brain" of the 3176B/3406E Electronic Engine Control System is two components working together:
                the Electronic Control Module (ECM) and the Vehicle Personality Module (VPM). The ECM is mounted on the
                left side of the engine and the VPM is mounted on the ECM. The ECM is the computer which controls the
                engine related vehicle functions. The VPM contains the operating instructions (software) including owner
                selected parameters and other engine information for the ECM to use, controlling how the ECM behaves.

            <para>The International engine harness connects to the Caterpillar engine harness using International 40-pin

                <emph type="bold">Caterpillar 40-pin connector J1</emph>. All electronic communication between the
                International electrical system and the Caterpillar engine control system go through (551)/J1, the
                International/Caterpillar connection.

                vehicle batteries through International engine harness connector (558), terminal 6. The battery power to
                the ECM is switched ON or OFF by the Run Relay (486), which is energized when the key switch is in the
                IGN position.

            <para>Cruise Control ON-OFF Switch (419)</para>
            <para>The ECM needs to know if the Cruise ON/OFF switch is in the ON or OFF position. To accomplish this the
                Cruise ON/OFF switch is connected to the ECM with an input circuit 97AE and a "common" or ground circuit
                97-GH.

                <para count="1">Each International installed switch has an "input" circuit that is connected through
                    connector (558) to an assigned ECM terminal. This circuit has 5 volts applied at the ECM terminal.

            <step1>
                <para count="1">When the Cruise switch is OFF (switch open), the ECM sees 5 volts at ECM terminal 20.
                    Placing the cruise switch to the ON position (switch closed) causes the ECM to see 0 volts (ground
                    voltage will be 0 to 0.5 volts) at terminal 20. The ECM programming has established that the Cruise
                    Control Switch is OFF when it sees 5 volts at connector (558) terminal 20 or cruise is ON when the
                    ECM sees 0 volts at terminal 20.

            <para>EXAMPLE: The service brake switch (317) is connected by input circuit 97AL to connector (558) terminal
                14. Terminal 14 has a 5-volt signal present. With the brake switch closed (pedal released) the circuit
                is complete between terminals 14 (input) and 29 (common or ground). This causes the 5 volt signal at
                terminal 14 to go to zero. This tells the ECM that the service brake switch is closed (pedal released).
            </para>
            <para>This type of circuit is used to communicate switch and some sensor information to the ECM. Some
                sensors receive a 5 volt signal and return a variable voltage indicating some variable attribute. The
                ECM also uses 12 volt circuits to enable (energize) relays in the system and
                <emph type="underscr">supplies 8V power</emph>
