            <para>The speedo/tach module microprocessor is electronically programmed to accept information from the
                engine Electronic Control Module (ECM) by way of the SAE J1708 data link. However, the physical
                positions of the DIP switches are at the "0" position. The axle ratio, tire revolutions per mile, number
                of teeth on the transmission speedometer gear, etc. are programmed into the engine ECM and not the
                speedo/tach module.
