        <title>SHIFT SELECTORS</title>
        <svcprocinfo>
            <para>With the lever selector, to move the shift lever
                <hotlnk xrefid="f0824603">(Figure 3)</hotlnk>
                between "R," "N," and "D," a lockout must be disengaged by using the thumb release on the shifter
                handle. All other ranges can be selected by moving the lever without using the thumb release.
            </para>
            <para>With the pushbutton selector, all of the ranges are selected by pushing the desired button. The
                transmission ECU will prevent selections that might damage the vehicle or cause a safety issue.
            </para>
            <para>The shift selector is equipped with a digital display. In the operating mode, the display indicates
                the range selected. (The WTEC III controls no longer show both the range selected and the range
                obtained.)
            </para>
            <para>The display has an LED to indicate MODE ON. This indicator has two meanings. In the normal operation
                of the transmission, it indicates that a secondary or special operating condition has been selected by
                the operator by depressing the MODE button. In the diagnostic mode, the MODE ON indicator means the
                displayed code is currently active. The transmission ECU is programmed to indicate the occurrence of a
                diagnostic code by illuminating the CHECK TRANS light.
            </para>
            <para>The brightness control for the shift display illumination is controlled by the dash panel light
                control, through the ECU. The ECU monitors the voltage output of the vehicle panel light brightness
                control and if no voltage is sensed by the ECU, the shift selector is set to full intensity. If a lower
                than ignition voltage is sensed, the display is not fully illuminated. If full ignition voltage is
                sensed, the display is again lighted at full intensity.

            <title>MODE BUTTON FUNCTION</title>
            <para>All shift selectors have a MODE BUTTON (
                <hotlnk xrefid="f0824603">Figure 3</hotlnk>). The button is used to activate special functions that have
                been programmed into the ECM or to perform system diagnostics when the vehicle is stopped. In a normal
                operating mode, the MODE status will be indicated by lighting "MODE ON" LED when the function is
                selected.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>SHIFT SCHEDULES</title>
            <para>PRIMARY - This shift schedule is used each time the vehicle is started. Typically this is used for
                normal vehicle operation.
            </para>
            <para>SECONDARY - This is an alternate shift schedule that the ECU may use when requested. The operator must
                request the alternate shift schedule with the MODE button.
            </para>
            <para>The control system logic protects the transmission from abuse. Such actions as full throttle
                neutral-to-range shifts and high speed direction changes are inhibited by the ECU.
