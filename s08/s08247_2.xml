                    <para>Before welding on any vehicle with an electronic control module for the transmission, engine,
                        antilock brake system or other electronically controlled components, it is mandatory to remove
                        all connectors going to the Electronic Control Module(s), including grounds. It is also
                        mandatory to disconnect the positive (+) and negative (- ) battery cables before connecting the
                        welder. Always attach welder ground cables as close as possible to the part being welded. Never
                        connect the welder ground cable to an ECM or ECM mounting bracket.

            <para>The contents of this service manual section focus on International-installed components and wiring and
                how those components function as part of the transmission electronic control system. For more detailed
                information regarding the Allison 2000 Series transmission and the Allison supplied components that are
                part of the electronic control system, refer to the appropriate Allison service manuals.

                <note>
                    <para>The majority of the troubleshooting procedures in this manual require using the EZ-Tech&#8482;
                        service tool with the TransPro&#174; diagnostic software, connected to the (9-pin) diagnostic
                        connector. TransPro software is available through Kent-Moore Heavy-Duty Division. A facility
                        that does not have the TransPro software will be limited to checking for system power to the
                        TCM, malfunctioning relays and poor connections.

            <para>The Transmission Control Module (TCM) is a microprocessor, which is the brain of the transmission

                Only Memory (EEPROM), which is programmed by Allison with a shift calibration that reflects the specific
                transmission.
