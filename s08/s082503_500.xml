            <para>The Auxiliary headlights system allows the driver to switch between standard headlights and auxiliary
                headlights mounted above a snowplow. Switching between the lights can only be performed when the key is
                on. If the key is turned off while the lights are on they will remain in that state until the key is
                turned on.
            </para>
            <para>Relays, controlled by the ESC, are used to switch headlight current between the standard headlights
                and the auxiliary headlights. The auxiliary headlight switch mounted in a switch pack will communicate
                with the ESC to request the lights to be switched.
            </para>
            <para>A separate relay is used for high beam and low beam auxiliary headlight operation.</para>
            <para>All auxiliary lights, other than the headlights, are connected to splices. No switching between
                standard and auxiliary headlights occurs on these circuits.
