            <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
            <para>The electrical system on these vehicles has been significantly redesigned. Unlike the electrical
                systems on previous models, which utilized point to point wiring for all input signals and output loads,
                this system uses multiplexed wiring technologies to provide control and communication between major
                functional areas of the vehicle. Multiplexing simply means, Communicating information through a small
                number of wires (called a data link) without requiring a wire for each piece of information. This
                information could be gauge information such as engine oil pressure, or switch information that controls
                vehicle functions such as headlamps. The electrical system relies on a collection of electronic circuit
                modules and software to perform vehicle functions instead of implementing similar features using complex
                wire harness designs with electromechanical relays and switches. These electronic module components are
                connected together by electronic data links. These data links can be thought of as computer networks
                that allow the electronic components on the vehicle to communicate with one another.
            </para>
            <para>The concept of multiplexing is not new to International&#174;. Data links for communicating between
                engine controllers, the instrument cluster and the diagnostic connector have been used for several
                years.
            </para>
            <para>The goal of multiplexing is to reduce cab harness wiring and to simplify circuits. This is
                accomplished by using low current data link circuits for communication between cab switches and the
                electrical system controller and the instrument cluster. Other data links in the vehicle allow other
                electrical controllers and the instrument cluster to communicate with each other.
            </para>
            <para>International multiplexing uses two types of data links; J1708 and J1939. The J1708 data link is often
                referred to as ATA and J1939 is often referred to as CAN.
            </para>
            <para>There are four separate data links used on the vehicle.</para>

                    <para>Drivetrain 1939 data link - This J1939 data link provides a path for communication between the
                        engine controller, transmission controller, antilock brake system (ABS) controller, pyrometer
                        ammeter module (PAM), electrical system controller (ESC), auxiliary gauge switch pack (AGSP) and
                        the electronic gauge cluster (EGC).

                    <para>1708 data link - This is the same J1708 data link (sometimes referred to as ATA) that has been
                        used in the past. This data link will be used almost exclusively for diagnostics and programming
                        of engines and other controllers.

            <para>The heart of the multiplexed system is the
                <hotlnk xrefid="f0825201">electrical system controller</hotlnk>
                (ESC). The ESC communicates with the switches on the switch data link, controllers from other features
                on the drivetrain 1939 data link and remote power modules on the body builder data link. It also
                receives input from various sensors and hard wire inputs throughout the truck. The ESC converts these
                inputs into data to be transmitted on the data links. It is also the power source for circuits that feed
                the components, controlled by the multiplexed switches, inside and outside of the cab.
