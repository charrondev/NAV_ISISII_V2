                        basic voltage test. An alternative method of checking for voltage drops within a given circuit
                        may be a quicker method of identifying an exact problem.

            <para>A fault in the wiper motor circuits will be apparent when the high or low speed wipers don't work. The
                ESC will log an active diagnostic trouble code when there is a short or open in the wiper power relay R1
                circuits or the wiper high-low relay circuits. Problems in the wiper circuits could be attributed to a
                failed relay, a failed motor, a tripped wiper motor circuit breaker, a short, an open or a problem in
                the ESC.

            <para>When the key is on the ESC will supply battery voltage to blue connector (4008) pin F. This voltage is
                applied to wiper motor connector (4015) cavity A, wiper power relay R1 pins 4 and 5, and wiper high-low
                relay R2.
            </para>
            <para>When high or low wipers are selected the ESC will supply a ground from system controller connector
                (4004) terminal 29 to wiper power relay 94003) R1 terminal 2. This will energize the wiper power relay
                and apply 12 volts to the common contact of wiper high-low relay (4003) R2.
            </para>
            <para>When low speed wipers are selected the wiper high-low relay will remain de-energized and the voltage
                at the common contact will pass through the normally closed contact to the low speed wiper motor
                windings.
            </para>
            <para>When high speed wipers are selected the wiper high-low relay will energize and the voltage at the
                common contact will pass through the normally open contact to the high speed wiper motor windings.
            </para>
            <para>Ground for the wiper motor is supplied from ground stud 2 (4006) to wiper motor connector (4015)
                terminal C.
