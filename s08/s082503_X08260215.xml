                    <para>The testing method for troubleshooting the electrical systems portrayed in this manual is a
                        basic voltage test. An alternative method of checking for voltage drops within a given circuit
                        may be a quicker method of identifying an exact problem.

            <para>A fault in the marker, park and tail lights will be apparent when the headlights are turned on and the
                marker, park and tail lamps don't come on. The ESC will also log a diagnostic trouble code (DTC) when
                there is a short in any of the marker, park and tail lamp circuits. Problems in the marker, park and
                tail lamp circuits can be caused by burned out lamps, a short, an open, or a problem in the ESC.

                tail light connector (72) terminal B is provided on circuit S68C from left tail light connector (71)
                terminal B.
