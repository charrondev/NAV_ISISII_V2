                <para>When probing connectors, always take care not to cause damage by forcing probe tips into cavities.
                    Use the appropriate tip adapters to prevent damage. Expanded cavities will cause increased circuit
                    resistance.

        <para>The Fluke 88 Digital Multimeter (DMM) is the meter recommended by International Truck and Engine

            is a digital meter, and is recommended because it uses very little current when performing tests. Digital
            meters have high impedance (resistance), 10 Mega ohms. Thus they do not damage components or give misleading
            readings.

            <caution>
                <para>Some of the devices in an electronic control system are not capable of carrying any appreciable
                    amount of current. Therefore the test equipment used to troubleshoot an electronic system must be
                    especially designed not to damage any part of it. Because most
                    <hotlnk xrefid="f0825008">analog meters</hotlnk>
                    use too much current to test an electronic control system, it is recommended that they not be used,
                    unless specified. The use of any kind of battery-powered test light, unless specified, is not
                    recommended when troubleshooting an electronic circuit, since it could also damage an electronic
                    control circuit.
