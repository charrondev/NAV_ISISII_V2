            <para>This system uses an electronically controlled air solenoid to supply pilot air to a larger air
                solenoid which will control the feature.
            </para>
            <para>The position of the switch on the dash panel is communicated to the ESC. The ESC will send signals to
                a remote air solenoid module containing the relay configured to operate the feature. Two different
                solenoid packs may be used to control the air pressure. The 7 solenoid version is controlled by J1939
                messages and the 4 solenoid version by discrete wire.
            </para>
            <para>The two speed axle feature allows the rear axle to shift to a much reduced gear ratio for the
                transportation of heavy loads. For automatic transmissions a switch in the dash labeled "2 speed LO" on
                bottom and "2 speed HI" on top allows the driver to select high or low rear axle ratio. The normal
                operating position would be high. If present the power divider lock (PDL) must be off in order for a
                shift to occur.
            </para>
            <para>The 2-speed axle is spring loaded to the low range gear, requiring air to shift to high gear. With the
                key off, the vehicle will stay or return to low range. When shifting from high range to low range the
                dash switch will be in the high axle (up) position. When the dash switch is set to low (down) position
                and the vehicle speed is less than the programmable maximum allowed shifting speed (default 3.2 kmh/2
                mph) and the PDL lock is not on, an air solenoid shifts the axle into low gear. Some countries such as
                Mexico may need the maximum allowed shifting speed set much higher as it is often used as a hi/lo
                splitter as the vehicle is up shifted.
            </para>
            <para>The PDL can be engaged in either high or low speed axle but is not allowed to be on during the shift.
                When shifting from low range to high range the dash switch will be in the low speed axle (down)
                position. When the dash switch is set to high (up) position and the PDL lock is not On, an air solenoid
                shifts the axle into high gear. PDL can be engaged in either high or low speed axle but is not allowed
                to be on during the shift. The vehicle speed restriction does not apply when shifting from low to high
                range. If a switch or speed error occurs, the two speed axle will remain in its current range for that
                ignition cycle. When the ignition is turned off, this feature turns the solenoids off. Upon key on, if a
                switch or speed error is active, the two speed axle will again remain in its current range for that
                ignition cycle. In the event of an air solenoid failure due to a shorted solenoid, this feature will
                request the ESC to turn off power to the air solenoid pack (or packs) to prevent uncontrolled operation
                of the solenoid. A switch indicator lamp is currently not available, but when introduced the switch
                indicator will blink slowly for errors and quickly when the feature is inhibited. If this feature
                commands its driven solenoid to turn on and the solenoid pack power has been turned off, this feature
                will blink the switch indicator slowly to communicate an error has prevented this feature from
                functioning.
