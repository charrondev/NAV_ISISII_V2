            <para>The ICAP ESC programming software must be used to configure instrument panel switches mounted in the 6
                pack switch modules to control air driven features. Each air driven feature is added with the ICAP
                software. The software will determine which switch will control the feature and how the remote air
                solenoid module is configured. The 4-pack air solenoid module is used when the number of air driven
                features is less than five. When more than four features are to be installed the 7-pack air solenoid
                module must be used.

            <para>The remote air solenoid module is mounted below the cab on the inside of the left frame rail or on the
                frame cross member. The primary air source is connected to the collar on the left side of the module. On
                the front of each air solenoid is an air collar to connect the air line to the air driven device. The
                electrical circuits are connected to the connector on the right side of the module. Overlay harnesses
                are available to complete the electrical connections.

            <title>Installing Additional Solenoids</title>
            <para>Individual solenoids are only installed on the module as required to support the features on the
                vehicle. If only one air driven feature is installed on the vehicle, only one solenoid will be installed
                on the module. If other air driven features are added, additional solenoids will need to be added.
            </para>
            <para>The last solenoid on the module will have a plug installed on the right side of the solenoid where the
                next solenoid would be installed. This plug blocks air flow out of the solenoid. When an additional
                solenoid is installed the plug must be removed from the existing solenoid and installed on the new
                solenoid.

            <para>Each additional air solenoid interlocks with the previous solenoid. The contacts of the solenoid slide
                through a foam strip to connect with the contacts of the solenoid module. The solenoid is secured to the
                module body with two Torx&#174; head screws.
            </para>
            <para>There are three types of air solenoids: normally open, normally closed and an air horn solenoid.
            </para>
            <para>The ICAP software will determine the location of the controlling switches in the switch packs and the
                order of installation for the solenoids.
            </para>
            <para>If more than four air driven features are installed on the vehicle, the 4 pack solenoid module will
                need to be replaced with a 7 pack module. Refer to

            </para>
            <para>This involves removing the 4 pack solenoid module and installing the 7 pack module. The circuits to
                the 4 pack module must also be removed and replaced with the harness for the 7 pack module. Refer to the
                circuit diagram book for circuit information.
            </para>
            <para>Individual solenoids from the 4-pack module can be saved for use in the 7-pack module.</para>
