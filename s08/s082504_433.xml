            <para>Driver controlled locking differential, when engaged helps prevent one side tire taking the majority
                of the power while slipping. Locking differential can only be engaged below maximum differential lock
                engagement speed (default 25 mph/40 Km). It will also disengage when the vehicle is speed is greater
                that maximum differential lock speed (default 25 mph/40 Km).
            </para>
            <para>When the "differential lock" switch is turned on (flipped up), the vehicle is below maximum
                differential locking engagement speed (default 25 mph/40 Km), and no errors or flags are present, the
                ESC will command the air solenoid to engage the locking differential. When the vehicle exceeds maximum
                differential lock speed, the differential lock will disengage.
            </para>
            <para>Locking differential disengaged (Off) is the default and fail-safe range. If the differential lock
                switch is set to On (up position) but the vehicle speed is greater than maximum allowed differential
                locking speed the locking differential will not engage. If the locking differential is engaged and the
                vehicle exceeds the maximum differential locking speed the ESC will command (remove power) disengagement
                of the locking differential. When the vehicle decreases speed to maximum differential locking speed or
                less the differential lock will not re-engage until the driver re-initiates differential lock (turns off
                then back on).
            </para>
            <para>If the switch is set On but the vehicle is speed is greater than (default 25 mph/40 Km), 5 short beeps
                will be generated and the switch ON light will continuously flash at a fast rate until differential lock
                is turned Off. Even if vehicle speed is reduced the Differential Lock switch light will continue to fast
                flash until the differential lock switch is turned Off. If the dash switch is malfunctioning or the
                vehicle speed message is not received, the switch ON light will continuously flash at a slow rate.
