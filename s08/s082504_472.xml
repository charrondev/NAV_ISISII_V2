            </para>
            <para>The dome lights are controlled by the door switch(es). Individual dome light(s) can also be turned on
                by their dome light switch.
            </para>
            <para>The dome light output from the ESC has theater style dimming capability, which can be disabled with
                programming. The lights will remain on if a door, with a switch mounted in the cab opening, is open. As
                soon as all doors are closed, and the dome light switch is off, the light will remain on at a modified
                level for 20 seconds or until the ignition has been started. At that time, the lights will dim gradually
                until the light is off.
            </para>
            <para>With theater lighting disabled the dome light(s) will go off as soon as the doors are shut.</para>
            <para>On January 28, 2003, the ESC software was revised. Prior to the revision, a door with a plunger type
                switch that was not fully latched would not turn off the dome light. If left on for an extended period
                of time, the dome light will drain the batteries. Now the dome light power will be cut back to 1% after
                10 minutes. Cycling the door plunger or key switch will reactivate the dome light.
            </para>
            <para>The remote keyless entry (RKE) also turns on the light for a timed period when the 'unlock' button is
                pressed, and turns off the light when the 'lock' button is pressed
            </para>
            <para>When a door is opened or closed the courtesy lights (located under the dash) will operate the same as
                the dome lights.
            </para>
            <para>The map lights are controlled by the switches on the lights.</para>
