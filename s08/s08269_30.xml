            <title>Twelve Volt Power Distribution (Battery/Alternator)</title>
            <para>Power is supplied by the vehicle batteries to the engine ECM power relay fuse (N/L) over circuits 14A
                and 14B. Power is also supplied by the vehicle batteries to the cranking motor solenoid battery stud (B)
                through a 4/0 wire and also by the alternator over circuit 2/2-FL/2A-FL. From the cranking motor
                solenoid stud (B), power is supplied to circuit 18-FL/18 going to the glow plug relay (N/L), circuit
                17-FL/17B to the start relay (387), and circuit 14B-FL/14B to the control box.
            </para>
            <para>From the "B" terminal, power is also supplied on circuits 14A-FL, 14-FL and 14 to the 1F feed stud.
                The feed stud (1F) supplies power to the power distribution center on circuits 14D/14A for the horn,
                stop light, and the turn signal/hazard light systems. Also on circuit 14D/14E for the diagnostic and
                programmable connector, and circuit 14D/94 for the ABS control system. The power distribution center is
                also supplied power on circuit 14D/14C for the headlight system, and on circuit 14D/19 for the key
                switch (20) and the fuel heater.

            <title>Twelve Volt Power Distribution (Key Switch)</title>
            <para>Power is supplied to the key switch through fuse F16 and circuit 15. When the key switch (20) is moved
                to the start position, power is supplied to the inline starter interrupt on circuit 17A, and to the rear
                engine key switch and connector (196) through circuit 17.
            </para>
            <para>When the key switch is in the ignition position, power is supplied to the power distribution center
                through circuit 13/13A for the fuel heater, ether start switch, and rear ignition feed, through circuit
                13/13H for the audible alarm, back-up lights, the accelerator system, and the fuel filter light, and
                also through circuit 13/13F for the instrument cluster, transmission temperature warning light, and the
                cruise control system. Power is also supplied to the power distribution center through circuit 12 for
                the ABS/Allison systems and to supply power for the body builder connector.
            </para>
            <para>When the key switch is moved to the accessories position, power is supplied to the power distribution
                center through circuit 12 for the ABS/Allison systems and to supply power for the body builder
                connector.
