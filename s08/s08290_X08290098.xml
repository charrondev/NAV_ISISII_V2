            <para>The alternator output must reach the batteries and accessory loads with a minimum amount of voltage
                loss. Any loss slows the rate of charge to the batteries and can cause the batteries to be undercharged.
                Discharged batteries can damage the starter and cause vehicle electrical components to operate
                improperly.

            <para>Most alternators control the maximum system voltage using a voltage regulator. Maximum voltage output
                is available at the alternator BAT terminal, but if any voltage is lost in the wiring, something less
                than the maximum will reach the batteries and load devices. The greatest losses occur when the charging
                system is outputting at the maximum rated level (amps).
