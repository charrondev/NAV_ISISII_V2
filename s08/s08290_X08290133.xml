                    <para>The testing method for troubleshooting the electrical systems portrayed in this manual is a
                        basic voltage test. An alternative method of checking for voltage drops within a given circuit
                        may be a quicker method of identifying an exact problem.

            <para>A fault in the wiper motor circuits will be apparent when the high or low speed wipers do not work.
                The ESC will log an active diagnostic trouble code when there is a short or open in the wiper power
                relay R1 circuits or the wiper high-low relay circuits. Problems in the wiper circuits could be
                attributed to a failed relay, a failed motor, a tripped wiper motor circuit breaker, a short, an open or
                a problem in the ESC.

                apply 12 volts to the common contact of wiper high-low relay R2.
