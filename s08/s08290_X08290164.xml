        <para>The post trip inspection relay governs a safety system to ensure that the driver inspects the vehicle when
            the route has been completed. This feature was added to ensure no passengers are left on the bus when it is
            secured at the end of its route.
        </para>
        <para>The post trip inspection system is armed when the service door is opened while the red pupil warning
            lights (PWL) are energized. While the engine is running the post trip inspection system will have no effect
            on any other system or vehicle operation.
        </para>
        <para>The post trip inspection system is activated when the key switch is turned off. At this point the operator
            will have sixty (60) seconds to do the following to disarm the system:

                <para>Opening and closing one of the emergency window exits or roof hatches will NOT disarm the post
                    trip inspection alarm. Only opening and closing the rear emergency exit will disarm the post trip
                    inspection alarm.

        <para>If the post trip inspection system is not disarmed in the allotted time then the electric horn will pulse
            and the headlights will flash for twenty minutes or until the alarm is disarmed as stated in the steps
            above.
