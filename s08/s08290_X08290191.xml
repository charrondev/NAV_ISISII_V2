            <para>This feature allows the back of the vehicle to lower several inches by dumping the air from the
                suspension bags. This is used mainly for trailer pickup and drop off as well as loading and unloading
                equipment on and off the back of straight trucks.
            </para>
            <para>When the suspension dump switch, mounted in the switch pack, is turned on the switch pack will
                communicate with the ESC to request the ESC to command the air solenoid, located in a 4 solenoid pack or
                a 7 solenoid pack, to energize. When the solenoid energizes it will supply pilot air to the Hadley valve
                of the air suspension system. This will cause the system to deflate.
            </para>
            <para>The suspension dump operations will occur only when the key switch is in the ignition position or
                accessory feed is on. The dump suspension indicator (solid light) and the dump suspension solenoid shall
                be on when the dump suspension switch is set to on, the vehicle is moving at the less than maximum
                allowed dump speed, and any related errors are not present. If the suspension is dumped and the ignition
                is turned off, the normally closed SV1 valve prevents inflating the suspension system. If the suspension
                is not dumped, the ignition is off and the switch is turned to the on position, upon turning the key to
                ignition or accessory the suspension will deflate.
            </para>
            <para>If there are any related errors the dump suspension solenoid shall be set to off. If vehicle speed is
                greater than maximum allowable dump speed the suspension dump solenoid will be set to off. If the
                suspension is deflated and the vehicle accelerates beyond the maximum dump speed the suspension will
                re-inflate even with the suspension dump switch in the dump position. If the vehicle then slows to
                maximum dump speed or less the suspension will not dump until the dump switch is re-initialized (turned
                off then back on).
            </para>
            <para>If there are any related errors and the accessory power is on, the suspension dump indicator will
                continuously flash slowly. If suspension dump is requested and vehicle speed is greater that maximum
                allowable dump speed (default 5 mph), the suspension dump indicator will continuously flash at a fast
                rate and five short beeps will occur. Even when the vehicle speed decreases below the maximum dump speed
                the suspension dump indicator will continue to flash fast.
