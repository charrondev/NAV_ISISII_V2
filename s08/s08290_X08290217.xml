            <para>The ESC controls the turn and stop lights based on inputs from the turn signal switches and brake
                switch.
            </para>
            <para>A combination turn/stop lamp system is standard on this vehicle. The turn signal overrides the stop
                lights on the rear.
            </para>
            <para>The turn signal and hazard lights are selected with the turn signal lever and hazard switch on the
                steering column.
            </para>
            <para>On vehicles with hydraulic brakes the stop light signal to the ESC comes from a switch activated by
                the brake pedal.
            </para>
            <para>On vehicles with air brakes the stop light signal to the ESC comes from switches, connected to the air
                brake lines, activated by brake air pressure. The switches are located near the steering column.
            </para>
            <para>The ESC has separate outputs supplying current for each front turn lamp and each rear turn/brake lamp.
                Additional turn lamps, which only illuminate when turn signals are selected, should be connected to the
                front turn signal circuits. Additional lamps required to illuminate with turn signals and brake lights
                should be connected to the rear turn signal circuits. The flashing of the turn signals and hazard lights
                is controlled by the ESC.
            </para>
            <para>When the hazard lights are activated the turn signal will not affect operation of the lights.
                Normally, the brake switches will override the hazards. The ESC can be programmed to allow the hazard
                lights to override the rear brake lights.
