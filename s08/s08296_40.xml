            <title>Twelve Volt Power Distribution Battery/Alternator W/VT365</title>
            <para>Power is supplied by the vehicle batteries to the engine ECM power in-line fuse (N/L) over circuits
                14A and 14A. Power is also supplied by the vehicle batteries to the cranking motor solenoid battery stud
                (B) through a 4/0 wire and also by the alternator over circuit K2/K2-FL/K2A-FL. From the cranking motor
                solenoid stud (B), power is supplied to circuit K18-FL/K18 going to the glow plug relay (6010), circuit
                K17D-FL/K17D to the start relay (6310-1), and circuit K14B-FL/K14B to the control box.
            </para>
            <para>From the "B" terminal, power is also supplied on circuits N14A-FL, N14-FL and N14 to the 1F feed stud.
                The feed stud (1F) supplies power to the power distribution center on circuits A14D/A14A for the horn,
                brake/cruise interface relay, air stop light, and the turn signal/hazard light systems. Also on circuit
                A14D/A14E for the diagnostic and programmable connector, and circuit A14D/A94 for the ABS control
                system. The power distribution center is also supplied power on circuit A14D/A14C for the headlight
                system, and on circuit A14D/A19 for the key switch (20) and the fuel heater relay.

            <title>Twelve Volt Power Distribution (Key Switch)</title>
            <para>Power is supplied to the key switch through fuse F16, circuit A15A/A15B and the ignition switch relay
                (1711), circuit A15. When the key switch (20) is moved to the start position, power is supplied to the
                inline starter interrupt connector (195) w/hyd or (6348) w/air, circuit A17A, and to the rear engine key
                switch (6305) and the starter &#38; ISO power relay (6310) through circuit V17.
            </para>
            <para>When the key switch is in the ignition position, power is supplied to the ignition switch relay coil
                (1711), circuit A13L, energized through circuits A11-GX/A11-GB, to the platform ground (4PG). Power is
                supplied to the power distribution center, circuits A15/A13, through the closed contacts of the ignition
                switch relay (1711). Power is supplied through circuit A13/A13A for the MSM module, the fuel heater
                relay, the rear ignition feed, the clutch switch, and the hyd brake pump control. Power is supplied
                through circuit A13/A13C for the air ABS power relay. Power is supplied through circuit A13/A13F for the
                ABS warning light, the instrument cluster, the ABS warning light relay, the hyd ABS/Allison
                interconnect, and the brake/cruise interface relay. Power is supplied through circuit A13/A13H for the
                audible alarm, the back-up light switch, the accelerator pedal switch, and the fuel filter light. Power
                is supplied from the key switch (20) to the power distribution center through circuit A13E, fuse F26,
                circuit A13D to supply power for the body builder connector (169).
            </para>
            <para>When the key switch is moved to the accessories position, power is supplied to the power distribution
                center through circuit A12, fuse F9, circuit A12D to supply power for the body builder connector (169).
