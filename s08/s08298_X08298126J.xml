        <para>The post trip inspection relay governs a safety system to ensure that the driver inspects the vehicle when
            the route has been completed. This feature was added to ensure no passengers are left on the bus when it is
            secured at the end of its route.

        <para>The
            <hotlnk xrefid="f08298939">Post Trip Inspection System</hotlnk>
            system is armed when the service door is opened while the red pupil warning lights (PWL) are energized.
            While the engine is running the post trip inspection system will have no effect on any other system or
            vehicle operation.
        </para>
        <para>The post trip inspection system is activated when the key switch is turned off. At this point the operator
            will have sixty (60) seconds to do the following to disarm the system:

                    trip inspection alarm. Only opening and closing the rear emergency exit can disarm the post trip
                    inspection alarm.
