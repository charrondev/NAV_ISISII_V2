        <para>This feature allows the back of the vehicle to lower several inches by dumping the air from the suspension
            bags. This is used mainly for trailer pickup and drop off as well as loading and unloading equipment on and
            off the back of straight trucks.
        </para>
        <para>When the suspension dump switch, mounted in the switch pack, is turned on the switch pack will communicate
            with the ESC to request the ESC to command the air solenoid, located in a 4 solenoid pack or a 7 solenoid
            pack, to energize. When the solenoid energizes it will supply pilot air to the Hadley valve of the air
            suspension system. This will cause the system to deflate.
        </para>
        <para>The suspension dump operations will occur only when the key switch is in the ignition position or
            accessory feed is on. The dump suspension indicator (solid light) and the dump suspension solenoid shall be
            on when the dump suspension switch is set to on, the vehicle is moving at the less than maximum allowed dump
            speed, and any related errors are not present. If the suspension is dumped and the ignition is turned off,
            the normally closed SV1 valve prevents inflating the suspension system. If the suspension is not dumped, the
            ignition is off and the switch is turned to the on position, upon turning the key to ignition or accessory
            the suspension will deflate.
        </para>
        <para>If there are any related errors the dump suspension solenoid shall be set to off. If vehicle speed is
            greater than maximum allowable dump speed the suspension dump solenoid will be set to off. If the suspension
            is deflated and the vehicle accelerates beyond the maximum dump speed the suspension will re-inflate even
            with the suspension dump switch in the dump position. If the vehicle then slows to maximum dump speed or
            less the suspension will not dump until the dump switch is re-initialized (turned off then back on).
        </para>
        <para>If there are any related errors and the accessory power is on, the suspension dump indicator will
            continuously flash slowly. If suspension dump is requested and vehicle speed is greater that maximum
            allowable dump speed (default 5 mph), the suspension dump indicator will continuously flash at a fast rate
            and five short beeps will occur. Even when the vehicle speed decreases below the maximum dump speed the
            suspension dump indicator will continue to flash fast.
