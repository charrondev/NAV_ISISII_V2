            <para>This is an electrical connection point for detecting when the air conditioner clutch is ON. No direct
                electrical connection point is provided for tapping into the A/C clutch wire. However, if an A/C Clutch
                connection is necessary, the body builder may use weather sealed splice techniques to tap into wire J77B
                at the ESC. The added load required by the body builder should not exceed 2 amps. This control wire
                shall be at battery volts when the A/C clutch is ON and 0 volts when OFF. The software in the ESC
                determines when this wire shall be ON or OFF based upon the mode of the HVAC controls in the cab and
                condenser temperatures and high side pressures of the A/C System. This control wire shall be OFF as
                necessary to protect the A/C compressor.
