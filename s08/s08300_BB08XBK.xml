            Feature code 08XBK provides a 40 Amp battery feed for customer use. An in cab rocker switch controls the
            circuit. A blank window switch is provided with this feature along with a graphic overlay kit that allows
            custom labeling of the switch function.

        <para>A blunt cut wire (Light Green) taped back to the Dash Harness near the PDC is provided for customer
            interface to this circuit. The battery feed to this wire is through a relay that is enabled by a ground from
            ESC connector 1601 when the switch is activated.
