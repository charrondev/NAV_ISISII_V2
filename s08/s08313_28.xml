        <title>INSTRUMENT CLUSTER</title>
        <svcprocinfo>
            <para>The cluster is a reliable, quick-disconnect package for the most commonly used instruments. Should the
                need arise, the cluster body can be quickly detached from the instrument panel for quick access to any
                of its components. Either the complete cluster assembly or any of its components can be replaced.
            </para>
            <para>Always place the ignition in the OFF position (not ACC) prior to working on the cluster, due to
                potential shorting between the ground and ignition pins, which will damage the circuit board and gauges.

                <caution>
                    <para>Static electricity can cause permanent damage to the cluster. Before working on the cluster,
                        be sure you have removed all static electricity from your body by touching metal that is
                        grounded. Do not wear clothing that causes static build up (such as nylon). Do not touch any pin
                        connectors during removal and installation of gauges. Work on the cluster in a clean environment
                        to avoid dust.
