            <para>The sensor (
                <hotlnk xrefid="f0831413">Figure 13</hotlnk>) is a magnetic pickup which senses the rotation of the
                speedometer gear mounted in the transmission. A permanent magnet located in the sensor establishes a
                magnetic field at the tip of the sensor. The field is repeatedly interrupted by the teeth of the
                speedometer gear in the transmission, creating voltage impulses from the vehicle speed sensor (VSS).
                When Fuller manual transmission, these are transmitted through connector (303), on circuits K47 and
                K47A, to connector (6021) on the ECM2. When Allison WTEC automatic transmission, these are transmitted
                from connector (7983), on circuits K139 and K148, to connector (7203) on the ECU, and these are
                transmitted from the control module connector (7204), on circuits K157, to connector (6021) on the ECM2.
                Or, Allison 2000 (LCT) automatic transmission, these are transmitted from connector (7600), on circuits
                K215 and K216, to connector (7304) on the TCM, and these are transmitted from the control module
                connector (7305), on circuits K126/K126W, to connector (6021) on the ECM2. The ECM2 converts the sensor
                signal to a digital data signal. This signal is transferred over the data link on circuits A98E(+) and
                A98F(-) to pins 7 and 9 of connector (11), into the instrument cluster. The instrument cluster's
                microprocessor drives the speedometer.

                    <para>The greatest variable in determining speedometer accuracy is tire revolutions per mile.
                        Factors which can affect tire revolutions per mile are tire manufacturing tolerances, tire load,
                        tire pressure, vehicle speed and tire wear.
