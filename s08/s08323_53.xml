            </para>
            <para>This feature consists of a switch mounted in the center panel with wiring that is routed up the right
                "A" pillar. The circuit is protected with a 20 AMP fuse. This feature is only available on the 7000
                models.

            <para>This switch is "hard wired" and there are no multiplex circuits associated with this feature. The
                switch is lighted to give an "ON" indication.

                    <para>This feature does not depend on any IGN key position, and can be turned on with the key off.
                        Care must be taken as leaving the switch on may discharge batteries.

            <para>Since the desired hole location for the harness to exit the cab and location may vary from customer to
                customer, circuits are left in roof for customer to drill hole.
            </para>
            <para>Note that there are roof reinforcements that should not be drilled into. Lower headliner to locate
                harness and determine best hole location. Install grommet into the hole and seal around cables and
                grommet to prevent leakage of moisture into cab.
            </para>
            <para>When connecting to load, be sure to use sealed connectors or a splice protected with heat shrink
                sleeve with an adhesive inner lining.
