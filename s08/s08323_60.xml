            <para>This chapter describes the optional gauges that are either installed or can be installed in the
                instrument cluster. If the vehicle was ordered without a desired gauge, one or more can be added in the
                field. Programming of the Body Controller (BC) and proper placement is critical. Certain gauges will
                only work in certain locations. Before adding the gauge to the vehicle, ensure that the vehicle can
                accept it. The outboard four gauges are the only ones that can be moved or added. They can be added by
                using the Diamond Logic&#174; Builder software. Follow the steps below for adding a gauge to the cluster
                (those without Diamond Logic&#174; Builder should see an International dealer). The following
                instructions can be followed for any of the four auxiliary gauge positions.

                        open location identified by a large blue circle. If the gauge will not move to a particular
                        position, it is not designed to work in that location.
