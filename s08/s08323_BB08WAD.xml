        <para>The disconnect switch is used to shut down the entire battery-fed electrical system. When a vehicle is not
            going to be used for several days or longer, this switch will shut off the system so that the electrical
            components on the vehicle, if left on, do not drain the batteries of their charge. Customers have the choice
            between a key or lever operated battery disconnect switch.

        <specpara>
            <note>
                <para>The disconnect switch should never be used to shut off the engine as there is a possibility of the
                    alternator generating a high positive voltage spike which may result in electrical damage.

        </para>
        <para>The disconnect switch cannot be put into the battery Ground (GND) cable as was previously done. The
            electronic modules will provide a GND path around the master disconnect switch if this is tried. The engine
            and transmission modules must always be connected to the batteries, even when the master disconnect switch
            is open. Separate power and GND circuits are provided on each vehicle to the engine and transmission
            electronics. To install a master disconnect switch, splice into the positive battery cable, or use OEM
            cables, going from the batteries to the cranking motor and insert disconnect switch into that circuit, as
            shown in Figure 1. Ensure that adequate electrical insulation is used between the positive battery cable,
            the switch mounting, and the surrounding area. Place boots or covers over the disconnect switch studs to
            protect the batteries and cables from accidental shorting. Do not disturb the direct connections from the
            battery to the engine or transmission electronics. To reduce corrosion, dielectric grease should cover
            eyelets and studs.

            </caution>
        </specpara>
        <para>If a non-OEM switch is to be used, make sure it is designed to handle at least 1,000 AMPS (intermittent
            duty)

            <note>
                <para>If there is more than one positive cable, eyelet terminals will have to be stacked on the switch
                    stud. Some installations may not have GND strap to rail - if none exists, there is no need to add
                    one.
