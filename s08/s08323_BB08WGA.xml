        </para>
        <para>These air solenoids provide Instrument Panel (IP)-mounted, rocker switches and normally closed and/or
            normally open air solenoids that allow the operator to control up to four normally closed or five or six
            normally open body-mounted air accessories from the cab. Note: these air solenoids are to be used as a pilot
            air source and are not to be used as an air supply. All of the air solenoid feature codes include windowed
            latching rocker switches and do not include any interlock features. Product graphics are included for
            application to each switch window.
        </para>
        <para>The air solenoids will turn off and the air will be exhausted for normally closed solenoids, and air
            pressure will be maintained with the normally open solenoids with the IGN key turned off. Take precautions
            to ensure that equipment controlled by these solenoids will not cause personal injury when the IGN key is
            turned off.
