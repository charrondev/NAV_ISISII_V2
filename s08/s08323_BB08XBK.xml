        <para>A blunt-cut wire (light green) taped back to the dash harness near the megafuse is provided for customer
            interface to this circuit. The battery feed to this wire is through a relay that is enabled by a 12V signal
            from the BC connector 1601 pin E16 when the switch is activated.
