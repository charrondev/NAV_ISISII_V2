        <para>Driver and passenger power windows and door locks are available. The driver switches are located on the
            driver door trim and can control all door windows and locks. The passenger switches are located on the
            passenger door trim and can control the passenger door window and all locks. Window express down is
            available for all window switches by momentarily depressing the window down switch. The driver can "lockout"
            all non-driver controllable window switches by momentarily depressing the lower left switch on the driver
            door control.

        <para>The International Keyless Entry System uses electronic door pods in the driver and passenger side doors
            which also operate the power door locks and the power windows. If equipped with Remote Keyless Entry
            (optional code), the memory in the receiver (front passenger door pod) learns the transmitter codes from the
            key fobs (transmitters) and only recognizes those which it has learned in the programming process. Each
            vehicle's passenger side door pod has the ability to learn up to six transmitter codes allowing the vehicle
            to be accessed by six different key fobs. Each key fob has a unique code which can be learned by any number
            of RKE equipped vehicles.

            additional programming of the Body Controller (BC) is required to operate the horn, panic, and dome light
            functions with RKE.

                be released. During the ten second "Learn Mode" any function on the new fob/transmitter must be keyed at
                least twice (See NOTE 1).

            <para>NOTE 1. After the transmitter is learned, the next keying of the new transmitter will perform the
                indicated function. It is recommended that the transmitter be successively keyed until the selected
                key's function is actually performed; i.e., pressing the lock button on the transmitter two times should
                learn its code; on the third push, it should lock the door and momentarily beep the city horn. This is a
                good way to quickly confirm the success of the learning.
