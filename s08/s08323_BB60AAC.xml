        </para>
        <para>The Power Pack 3 Inverter system is an advanced Power Generation and Power Management system to provide
            both DC power and an on-board 120 volt AC power source. The Power Pack 3 system is integrated with the
            Diamond Logic&#174; Electrical system. The DC portion of the system provides 14 volts DC at a maximum of 100
            Amperes (AMPS) to charge the vehicle batteries. The AC portion of the system provides a 120 Volts AC single,
            phase 60 Hertz output at a maximum of 25 AMPS. The system may be ordered from International,
            factory-installed either mounted in the battery box or as a temporary mounted inverter module behind the
            cab. The body upfitter is tasked with mounting the inverter in a body compartment with the temporary mount.
        </para>
        <para>The Power Pack system consists of an inverter module, a special 3-phase 42 volt AC alternator, a
            multiplexed switch in the cab, and associated wiring harness. The engine must be running in order for the
            Power Pack system to generate AC or DC voltages. The 120 volt AC output is only functional when the vehicle
            is stationary with the park brake set. The 120 volt AC output contains a Ground (GND) fault interrupter
            device and a weather sealed power plug.

            <caution>
                <para>If 120 volts AC Shore power is integrated into the body wiring, the shore power connection must
                    never be directly connected to the Power Pack 3 AC output.

            <emph type="bold">USING POWER PACK 3 WITH REMOTE ENGINE SPEED CONTROL:</emph>
        </para>
        <para>Power Pack 3 provides full power output for the 120 volt AC section at an engine RPM of 935 or greater.
            The Power Pack 3 inverter module uses special datalink commands to raise the engine RPM to 935 when the 120
            volt AC rocker switch is turned on. Since the engine cannot respond to both datalink commands and direct
            Engine Control Module (ECM) hard wired engine speed control commands, the body upfitter must use specific
            alternative wiring methods to permit remote engine speed control from remote body locations as well as allow
            Power Pack 3 to raise engine speed as required. Vehicles equipped with Power Pack 3 may not be used with the
            feature 12VZA which provides remote engine speed control through hard wires connected directly to the engine
            ECM. The following alternative features are compatible with Power Pack 3 and may be used to achieve various
            engine speed control functions.

        <para>When the Power Pack 3 AC output is turned off and no other form of remote engine speed control is
            requested, the engine will be at an idle speed of approximately 700 RPM. If the Power Pack 3 AC switch is
            turned on, the engine speed shall be increased to 935 RPM. If another form of remote engine speed control is
            activated, the Power Pack 3 will release engine speed control to that input. When the remote engine speed
            request is removed, the engine will return to 935 RPM until the Power Pack is turned off.

        <para>Parameter PPE3_param_incrThrottle_startDelay is the amount of time that the Power Pack will wait to turn
            on. This is to allow the engine to ramp to the operating RPM before the Power Pack is activated.

        <para>Parameter PPE3_param_incrThrottle_targetRPMs is the target RPM for the engine to ramp to when the Power

        <para>Parameter PPE3_param_incrThrottle_timeout is the amount of time that the inverter is inhibited from coming

        <para>A Hubbell Watertight Safety-Shroud male plug (Hubbell part number HBL2611SW) is needed to connect to the
            AC output plug to mate with the Power Pack supplied Hubbell Watertight Safety-Shroud female socket (Hubbell
            part number HBL2613SW). These plugs are available at electrical and industrial supply houses.
        </para>
        <para>Using this part combination will allow for a weather resistant connection to the Power Pack 3 unit.
            Alteration of the AC output plug, failure to use the correct male plug, or removal of the supplied socket
            will not guarantee a watertight connection.
        </para>
        <para>The AC output from the Power Pack 3 is wired to a Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI) to ensure
            protection against GND fault conditions. Be aware that standard duplex GFCI and non-GFCI receptacles need to
            be protected with a circuit breaker, usually rated for 15 or 20 AMPS.
