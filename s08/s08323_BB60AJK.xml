        <para>060AJK - INDICATOR LIGHTS (2), One for Body Up, One for Gate Open, Includes Audible Alarm, Programmable
            Mode for Various Switch Actions (Requires 2 RPM Inputs).

            <emph type="boldundersc">FEATURE / BODY FUNCTION:</emph>
        </para>
        <para>This feature provides the operator of Dump Box Applications with visual and audible warning indications
            for a raised dump box body and open dump gate using Body Builder-installed switches. The visual indications
            that are provided for this feature are a "Body Up" light and a "Gate Open" light. Red indicator lights are
            located in prime viewing area of the driver in the switch pack. Audible alarm provides a second level of
            warning to the driver to indicate the status of these two equipment options.
        </para>
        <para>The "Gate Open" indicator light is on constant when the gate open input is active with the park brake set.
            If the park brake is released, with the gate open input active, the gate open indicator shall flash at 0.6
            second intervals, accompanied by an audible alarm. Flexibility is provided through programmable parameters
            to establish whether the inputs are active high (12V) or active low (GND). See the Diamond Logic&#174;
            Builder software to set programmable parameters.
        </para>
        <para>For both the "BODY UP" and "GATE OPEN" indications, the associated light will illuminate continuously and
            the associated audible alarm (default off) will sound when the corresponding input has entered an active
            state on the condition that the park brake is set and the vehicle speed is less than or equal to 10 MPH.
        </para>
        <para>For both the "BODY UP" and "GATE OPEN" indications, the associated light will illuminate in a slow
            flashing manner and the associated audible alarm (default of five fast beeps) will sound when the
            corresponding input is in an active state and either the park brake has been released or the vehicle speed
            has exceeded 10 MPH.
        </para>
        <para>Both the "BODY UP" and "GATE OPEN" lights will be off when the RPM input is inactive.</para>
