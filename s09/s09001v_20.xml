            <para>Improper positioning of the hood relative to the cab can cause the tilt mechanism to malfunction and
                can interfere with engine components. The front of the hood is to be at the proper height, which will
                allow a parallel gap between the bottom front edge of the hood and the bumper. The hood is to be
                centered so the clearances for the radiator and air intake box-to-splash panels and shock absorbers are
                adequate.
            </para>
            <para>Before adjusting the hood, be sure the chassis is on a level surface and the hood is mounted properly
                to the cab. Adjust the radiator-to-cowl dimension, square the cab on the chassis and adjust cab air
