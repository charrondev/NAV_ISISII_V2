            <para>Improper positioning of the hood relative to the cab can cause the tilt mechanism to malfunction and

            <para>The front of the hood is to be at the proper height, which will allow a parallel gap between the

            </para>
            <para>The hood is to be centered so the clearances for the radiator and air intake box-to-splash panels and
                shock absorbers are adequate.
            </para>
            <para>Before adjusting the hood, be sure the chassis is on a level surface and the hood is mounted properly
                to the cab. Adjust the radiator-to-cowl dimension for IC BUS, as follows.
