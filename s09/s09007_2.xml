            <para>The 7000 series chassis is the severe service application vehicle in the International Truck equipment
                vehicle line up. The chassis is designed with a higher unit profile to ensure component and ground
                clearance. The 7300, 7400 and 7500 series all incorporate the International Engine configurations.
            </para>
            <para>The 7600 series chassis is designed primarily to handle the severe service large bore engine
                application. This requirement increases cab/engine height clearance for cab, hood, fenders and grille.
                This application also changes the front axle location to accommodate the various non International
                engines. The axle location is set forward which changes the design and size of the various front end
                components.
            </para>
            <para>The entire line of Severe Service application vehicles is available in both single axle drive and all
                axle drives.
