            <title>OIL QUALITY</title>
            <para>An oil container symbol system has been developed to help you choose the proper oil. The top portion
                of the symbol shows the oil quality, such as API Service CG-4/SH (
                <hotlnk xrefid="f1000101">Figure 1</hotlnk>). The symbol may show additional categories, such as API
                Service SG/CE, SF/CE. The center portion will probably show viscosity grade, such as SAE 15W-40 (
                <hotlnk xrefid="f1000101">Figure 1</hotlnk>). If the lower portion shows "Energy Conserving II," be sure
                the upper and center portions show the correct API service category and proper SAE viscosity grade
                recommended for your engine.

            <para>Oil quality is described by API (American Petroleum Institute) engine service categories. API
                categories are defined by oil performance (deposits and wear) measured in standard engine tests. API "S"
                category SH describes oils for spark ignition (gasoline) engines, while "C" categories (CF-4, CG-4)
                describe oils for diesel engines. Oils with both "S" and "C" categories (such as CG-4/SH) are suitable
                for both spark ignition and diesel engines. Sometimes, the "S" and "C" categories are reversed (such as
                SH/CG-4).
            </para>
            <para>The oil quality recommended depends on engine type and engine design. There are many supplementary
                fuel and oil additives for sale. If you follow the lubricant and oil change interval recommendations,
                your engine will not require these additives.

                <note>
                    <para>Use of inappropriate API category engine oils severely compromises engine life. It is very
                        important that the recommended or the acceptable alternate API category shown in Table 1,
                        <hotlnk xrefid="f1000102">Figure 2</hotlnk>be used when selecting engine oil.

                <caution>
                    <para>Do NOT use oils specifically marketed by suppliers for stationary, marine, or railroad diesel
                        engines, or for stationary natural gas engines, even though they are marked API category CD or
                        CE. Such oils can cause excessive valve train wear and combustion chamber deposits. (These oils
                        are sold only in drums or bulk.)
