            <title>Introduction</title>
            <para>The customer's first experience with the vehicle and your Dealership makes a lasting impression that
                contributes to the overall image of the product and dealership personnel. Ensuring every International
                vehicle is ready for the customer, making the delivery a positive experience, and providing superior
                service after the sale all contribute to customer satisfaction. REMEMBER, EVERY CONTACT WITH THE
                CUSTOMER IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE SATISFACTION.
            </para>
            <para>Customers are much more likely to be satisfied with a dealership that takes responsibility at delivery
                time for new vehicle operation and appearance. This kind of commitment to product quality gets respect
                in the marketplace. To make the delivery experience the best it can possibly be, perform the following
                steps to help ensure your customers' satisfaction with the delivery process, and with the new vehicle.

                initiative was designed to help you improve customer retention and exceed your market performance. In

            <title>How To Know When You're Satisfying Your Customers</title>
            <para>To know how well your customers are satisfied with your dealership, you should ask them. Since you
                don't have time to interview every Customer, International "asks" for you by way of the Customer
                Satisfaction Process (CSP). CSP is a direct means of requesting your customers' feedback, with the
                purpose of gaining understanding of customer needs and expectations. Through recognition of your strong
                and weak points you can improve dealership performance, so you will better satisfy your customers.
            </para>
            <para>CSP provides many benefits: satisfied customers gain a favorable impression of the dealership, and are
                more likely to return for future purchases; also, they will convey their positive experiences and
                opinions to other prospective buyers. Customer satisfaction means new business, repeat business, and
                positive referrals.

                an International vehicle. This DELIVERY survey identifies the selling dealership and the purchased
                vehicle; the customer is asked to complete and return the questionnaire. The DELIVERY survey assesses
                the level of customer satisfaction in several essential areas:
