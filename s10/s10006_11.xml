        <para>Grease lubricants contain three substances:
            <emph type="bold">oil, a thickener base</emph>
            and
            <emph type="bold">additives</emph>.
        </para>
        <para>The oil lubricates, the thickener (base) holds the oil in place and releases it to provide the necessary
            lubrication; and the additives enhance the characteristics of the oil and thickener. Extreme Pressure (EP)
            additives help prevent scoring, galling and welding of moving parts.
        </para>
        <para>The thickener may be simple or complex soap (lithium, calcium, aluminum, etc.), organic (polyurea) or
            inorganic (clay).
        </para>
        <para>When mixing different greases, the possibility of incompatibility exists and should be considered. Mixing
            incompatible greases may reduce the lubricating ability of greases. International vehicles are filled with a
            lithium grease at the factory.
        </para>
        <para>An important property of a grease is its
            <emph type="bold">dropping point</emph>, the temperature where it changes from a semi-solid state to a
            liquid state. However, the operating temperature of a specific grease is not determined solely by the
            dropping point. Other properties such as resistance to change in consistency and chemical deterioration at
            high temperatures must be considered.

            <note>
                <para>Grease lubricants are classified by the National Lubricating Grease Institute (NLGI) and given
                    grade numbers based on consistency of the grease. Recently, the NLGI developed a new specification
                    and classification for automotive greases based on application. The NLGI issues licensed symbols (
                    <hotlnk xrefid="f1000104">Figure 4</hotlnk>) designating the application for which the grease is
                    approved.
