            <para>Bearing whine is a high-pitched sound similar to a whistle. It is usually caused by worn/damaged
                pinion bearings, which are operating at driveshaft speed. Bearing noise occurs at all driving speeds.
                This distinguishes it from gear whine, which usually comes and goes as speed changes.
            </para>
            <para>As noted, pinion bearings make a high-pitched, whistling noise, usually at all speeds. If, however,
                there is only 1 pinion bearing that is worn/damaged, the noise may vary in different driving phases. Do
                not install new pinion bearings unless bearings are scored or damaged or there is a specific pinion
                bearing noise. A worn/damaged bearing will normally be obvious at disassembly. Examine the large end of
                the rollers for wear. If the pinion bearings original blend radius has worn to a sharp edge, install a
                new pinion bearing.

            <para>Clunk is a metallic noise heard when the automatic transmission is engaged in REVERSE or DRIVE. The
                noise may also occur when throttle is applied or released. It is caused by backlash somewhere in the
                driveline or loose suspension components; it is felt or heard in the axle. For additional information,
                refer to Total Backlash Check in this section.
            </para>
            <para>Additionally, clunk may be heard upon initial drive-away. This occurs as engine torque shifts vehicle
                weight, forcing changes in driveline angles, preventing the driveshaft slip-yoke from sliding on the
                output shaft. To correct this condition, lubricate the slip-yoke splines. For additional information,

            <para>Driveline vibration exhibits a higher frequency and lower amplitude than does high-speed shake.
                Driveline vibration is directly related to the speed of the vehicle and is usually noticed at various
                speed ranges. Driveline vibration can be perceived as a tremor in the floor pan or is heard as a rumble,
                hum or boom. Driveline vibration can exist in all drive modes, but may exhibit different symptoms
                depending upon whether the vehicle is accelerating, decelerating, floating or coasting. Check the
                driveline angles if the vibration is particularly noticeable during acceleration or deceleration,
                especially at lower speeds. Driveline vibration can be duplicated by supporting the axle upon a hoist or
                upon jack stands, though the brakes may need to be applied lightly in order to simulate road resistance.
            </para>
            <step1>
                <para count="1">Raise the vehicle promptly after road testing. Use twin-post hoist or jack stands to
                    prevent tire flat-spotting. Engage the drivetrain and accelerate to the observed road test speed to
                    verify the presence of the vibration. If the vibration is not evident, check the non-driving wheels
                    with a wheel balancer to rule out imbalance as a possible cause. If necessary, balance the
                    non-driving wheels and repeat the road test. If the vibration is still evident, proceed to Step 2.

                    orientation on axles with dual rear wheels) and repeat the road speed acceleration. If the vibration
                    is gone, refer to the tire and wheel runout procedure in Wheels and Tires in S17002. If the
                    vibration persists, proceed to Step 3.

                    rear of the driveshaft and pinion flange. If these marks are more than one quarter turn apart,
                    disconnect the driveshaft and reindex it to align the marks as closely as possible. After any
                    corrections are made, recheck for vibration at the road test speed. If the vibration is gone,
                    reinstall the wheels and road test. If the vibration persists, proceed to Step 4.

                    driveshaft. If the front and center are within this limit, but the rear runout is not, mark the rear
                    runout high point and proceed to Step 5. If the runout is within the limits at all points, proceed

                    positions. Check the runout at the rear of the driveshaft. If it is still over 0.50 mm (0.020 inch),
