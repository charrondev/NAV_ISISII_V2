                    <title>OPERATION</title>
                    <para>The purpose of a clutch is to transfer the power of the engine from the flywheel to the
                        transmission. At the point in which clutch engagement is initiated, the transmission input shaft
                        may either be stationary, as when the vehicle is at a standstill, or rotating at a different
                        speed than the flywheel, as in the case of upshifting or downshifting. Once the clutch is fully
                        engaged, however, both the flywheel and the transmission input shaft will rotate at the same
                        speed.
                    </para>
                    <para>To perform this function, a clutch is equipped with a disc which has friction surfaces known
                        as facings. As the clutch pedal in the cab is depressed, the pressure plate is drawn away from
                        the flywheel, freeing the disc(s) from contact with the flywheel friction surface. At this point
                        the clutch is disengaged and the transfer of power from the engine to the transmission is
                        interrupted.
                    </para>
                    <para>As the clutch pedal is released, the disc(s) is clamped between the flywheel and the pressure
                        plate. The discs are designed to slip for a short period of time as they gradually accept the
                        torque of the flywheel. As pressure increases, the discs accept the full torque of the engine,
                        and rotate at the same speed as the flywheel. At this point engagement is complete and the power
                        of the engine is transferred to the transmission.
                    </para>

                        <title>OPERATING PRINCIPLES</title>
                        <para>The Angle-Spring Clutch operates under indirect pressure. That means the pressure springs
                            are located away from the pressure plate, rather than directly on it, and the spring load is
                            applied through a series of six levers. Spicer's Angle-Spring differs from most other
                            conventional clutches in that the plate load and release bearing load are not directly
                            proportional to the spring load.

                            </para>
                            <para>Pressure plate load is the result of the axial load of the springs multiplied by the
                                lever ratio. The pressure springs are positioned at an angle to the centerline of the
                                clutch with their ends attached to the flywheel ring (cover) and the release sleeve
                                retainer. As the release sleeve retainer, including the release sleeve and the release
                                bearing, is moved toward the flywheel, the springs pivot freely without bending or
                                buckling.

                                resulting in reduced pedal effort. The plate load is obtained from the axial component
                                of the spring force multiplied by the lever ratio. The axial component of the spring
                                force changes with release bearing movement, but not in direct proportion to the spring
                                load.

                            <para>When facings wear, spring load reduces but axial load remains constant. As the clutch
                                wears, the release sleeve assembly moves toward the flywheel, and the pressure springs
                                elongate and lose load. The axial component of the reducing spring force, however,
                                remains essentially constant. Therefore, the plate load remains constant throughout the
                                life of the clutch. In the worn position, the assist springs apply more load, indicating
                                that it's time for a clutch adjustment.

                            <para>When the clutch is adjusted to compensate for the facing wear, the pressure plate
                                position does not move, but the rotated adjusting ring moves the levers toward the
                                transmission, thus pushing the release sleeve and bearing assembly that direction also.
                                This in turn re-establishes the internal spring position back to an as-new setting for
                                continued clutch use.
