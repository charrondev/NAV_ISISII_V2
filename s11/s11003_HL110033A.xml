        <title>INTERNAL ADJUSTMENT MECHANISMS AND INSTRUCTIONS</title>
        <para>There are three types of adjustment mechanisms currently in use on Spicer Angle-Spring Clutches: two
            manual and one self-adjusting mechanism. When making an internal clutch adjustment, refer to the
            instructions described below for your type of adjustment mechanism.
