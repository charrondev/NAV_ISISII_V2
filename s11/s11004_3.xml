            <para>The Solo clutch operates under indirect pressure. The pressure springs are isolated from the pressure
                plate and the spring load is applied through six levers. As the clutch wears, the internal sliding cam
                adjusting mechanism maintains the pressure plate load and release bearing load in a like-new condition.
                A tab, visible on the outer surface of the cover assembly, indicates the wear condition of the clutch
                and ultimately when replacement is required.

            <para>Pressure plate load is the result of axial load of the springs multiplied by the lever ratio. The
                pressure springs are positioned at an angle to the centerline of the clutch with their ends connected to
                the adjusting ring and the release sleeve retainer assembly. When the clutch is engaged, the release
                sleeve retainer moves toward the flywheel and the pressure springs pivot without bending or buckling and
                apply clamping load to the pressure plate through the levers.

            <para>When the clutch pedal is depressed to release the clutch, the release bearing assembly and pressure
                plate move away from the flywheel. Since the clutch clamping load is removed, power from the engine to
                the transmission is no longer transmitted.

            <para>The Solo clutch automatically adjusts to compensate for facing wear. As the pressure plate moves
                toward the flywheel due to facing wear, the sliding cam adjusting ring rotates and re-establishes the
                release bearing and internal springs to an as-new position for continued clutch life.
