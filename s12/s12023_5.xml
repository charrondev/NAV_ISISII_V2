            <para>The RE bus utilizes a hydraulic system to drive the radiator fan and cool the radiator and charge air
                cooler. The hydraulic system responds to cooling requirements by monitoring engine temperatures. The
                hydraulic system consists of the following components: hydraulic pump, hydraulic reservoir, hydraulic
                fan drive motor, and hydraulic oil cooler.

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Hydraulic Reservoir and Filter</title>
            <para>The hydraulic reservoir provides a supply of clean, air-free oil to the hydraulic system. The
                hydraulic reservoir is vented and uses a two-site glass system for monitoring the oil level. The
                hydraulic reservoir is located to the right of the engine and can be accessed through the rear
                compartment service door.
            </para>
            <para>The hydraulic reservoir has an internal filter that filters return oil flow and can easily be replaced
                from the top of the hydraulic reservoir.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Hydraulic Pump</title>
            <para>The hydraulic pump provides oil flow for the hydraulic fan drive system and the power steering
                circuit. The hydraulic pump is mounted to the left side of the engine and can be accessed through the
                left-side rear compartment service door.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Hydraulic Fan Drive Motor</title>
            <para>The hydraulic fan drive motor drives the radiator fan to cool the charge air cooler and engine
                coolant. Hydraulic oil is supplied to the hydraulic fan drive motor by the hydraulic pump.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Hydraulic Oil Cooler</title>
            <para>The hydraulic system is protected by a hydraulic oil cooler to keep the hydraulic oil cool. The
                two-part hydraulic oil cooler allows the hydraulic oil to flow through the center of the hydraulic oil
                cooler while engine coolant flows through the outside of the hydraulic oil cooler. This process allows
                the engine coolant to cool the hydraulic oil.
            </para>
            <para>The hydraulic oil cooler is mounted to a crossmember behind the rear bumper and can be accessed
                through the rear compartment service door.
