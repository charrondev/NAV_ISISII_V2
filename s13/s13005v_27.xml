            <title>Cleanliness</title>
            <para>Transmissions should be steam cleaned prior to disassembly. Seal all openings before steam cleaning to
                prevent entry of dirt and water which can damage serviceable parts.
            </para>
            <para>Dirt is abrasive and will cause premature wear of bearings and other parts. We suggest that mechanics
                have a small wash tank to clean parts just prior to reassembly.

            <title>Bearings</title>
            <para>When a transmission is removed at relatively low mileage, bearings should be removed with pullers
                designed for this purpose. Wrap the bearings to keep out dirt. Clean, inspect and lubricate all bearings
                just prior to reassembly. If accumulated mileage is over 150,000 miles, we suggest that all bearings be
                replaced.

            <title>End Yokes and Flanges</title>
            <para>Hammering on end yokes and flanges to remove or install them is not only destructive to the yoke or
                the flange itself, but can also cause serious internal damage. Hammering destroys or mutilates the pilot
                diameters and warps or bends the flange. Hammering on end yokes will close-in the bearing bores or
                misalign yoke lugs and result in early failures of journal needle bearings, etc.
            </para>
            <para>Serious damage can be done internally to bearings, thrust faces and washers, pilot bearings, etc., by
                hammering on external parts. In most designs, when the yoke/flange locknuts are tightened and secure,
                the internal bearings and gears are in proper location. When the yoke/flange is driven on the shaft,
                however, two conditions can exist.
