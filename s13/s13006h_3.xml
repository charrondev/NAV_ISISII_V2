        <title>HOW TO SHIFT THE TRANSMISSION - Synchronizer Information</title>
        <svcprocinfo>
            <para>The purpose of a synchronizer is to simplify shifting and help deliver clash-free shifts. Low and
                reverse gears are not synchronized.
            </para>
            <para>When a shift is required, the driver depresses the clutch and moves the lever toward the desired gear.
                When the synchronizer ring makes contact with the desired gear,
                <emph type="italic">blockers</emph>automatically prevent the shift collar from completing the shift
                until the gear and mainshaft speeds are matched. When the speeds are matched, the synchronizer allows
                the shift to be completed without clashing.

            <title>UPSHIFTING</title>
            <para>To drive a vehicle containing this transmission, first depress the clutch and wait for complete
                release. Next, move the shift lever into 1st gear and accelerate to an RPM that will allow enough
                momentum to select the next higher gear and still have vehicle acceleration after completing the shift
                into 2nd gear. This is known as the progressive shift technique. Using this shift technique saves fuel.
                There is usually no reason to go all the way to the governor before you shift to 2nd gear. This method
                can vary depending on the GVW of the vehicle, road condition, and type of service. See
                <hotlnk xrefid="f1300602">Figure 2</hotlnk>.

            </figure>
            <para>When 2nd gear is desired, declutch and move the shift lever toward that gear. The synchronizer will
                pick up 2nd gear and synchronize its speed to the mainshaft speed. When synchronized, the lever moves
                easily into 2nd gear.
            </para>
            <para>Continue in the same manner to top road speed. Notice that as you approach top road speed you must
                accelerate close to the governed speed before allowing the engine to drop to the next gear shift point.
                This is because air resistance at higher speeds requires more of the available horsepower to get
                adequate performance. Maximum performance and horsepower are achieved at governed speed.

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>DOWNSHIFTING</title>
            <para>To begin downshifting from top gear, declutch and move the shift lever steadily toward 5th gear.
                (Normally you should start to shift about 100 RPM above the shift point.) The synchronizer will pick up
                5th gear and speed it up to the vehicle speed. This will allow a clash-free shift from 6th to 5th gear.
                After the shift, reengage the clutch while accelerating the engine to keep the vehicle moving at the
                desired speed. If further downshifts are required, continue in a similar manner.
            </para>
            <para>Remember that low gear isn't synchronized. Therefore, shifting into low gear will require a double
                clutch operation to complete a clash-free shift. The driver may double clutch on all shifts. Double
                clutching will aid the synchronizer by manually helping to match the engine speed and the road speed.
