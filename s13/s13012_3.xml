            <title>Synchronizer Information</title>
            <para>The purpose of a synchronized transmission is to simplify shifting and to help the driver get a clash
                free shift. To receive these results, however, it is important to understand how the synchronizer works.
            </para>
            <para>When a shift is required, the operator declutches and moves the shift lever toward the desired gear.
                When the synchronizer ring makes contact with the gear, the blockers automatically prevent the shift
                collar from completing the shift until the gear and mainshaft speeds are matched. At that time, the
                blocker neutralizes automatically. The lever moves smoothly and easily into gear.
            </para>
            <para>It takes one or two seconds to match speeds. Steady pressure on the shift lever helps the synchronizer
                do its job quickly. If the lever is "forced" into gear, it is possible to override a blocker. This
                defeats the purpose of the synchronizer, and can cause gear clash.
            </para>
            <para>Finally, remember that this transmission is not synchronized in first and reverse gears because these
                gears are normally selected when the vehicle is stationary. No synchronizing of engine speed and road
                speed is required to get in gear from a stop.
            </para>

            <title>Upshifting</title>
            <specpara>
                <caution>
                    <para>Always start in first gear. Starting in any other gear may cause hard shifting and internal
                        transmission damage because a synchronizer needs gear rotation to do its job.
                    </para>
                </caution>
            </specpara>
            <para>To begin shifting, first depress the clutch and wait for complete release. Move shift lever into 1st
                gear (
                <hotlnk xrefid="f1301201">Figure 1</hotlnk>). Next accelerate to an RPM that will allow enough momentum
                to select next higher gear while still allowing vehicle acceleration after the shift has been completed.
                There is usually no reason to go all the way to the governor before you shift to second. This
                progressive shift technique helps save fuel. This method can vary depending on the GVW of the vehicle,
                road condition, and type of service.
            </para>
            <para>When 2nd gear is desired, declutch and move the lever towards 2nd gear (
                <hotlnk xrefid="f1301201">Figure 1</hotlnk>), keeping steady pressure on the lever. The synchronizer
                will pick up the gear and synchronize its speed to the mainshaft speed. The lever will move into gear
                easily.
            </para>
            <para>Continue in the same manner to top road speed. Notice that to have good performance as you approach
                the top speed, you must accelerate closer to the governed speed before you allow the engine to drop to
                the next gear shift point. This is because air resistance at higher speeds requires more of the
                available horsepower. You receive maximum performance and horsepower at governed speed.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Downshifting</title>
            <para>When you downshift, use the same procedure. However, the engine RPM must be raised to the governor as
                the clutch is engaged after completing the shift. To downshift from top gear, declutch as you approach
                the shift point (about 100 RPM above the shift point) and move the shift lever with a steady even
                pressure toward 4th gear. The synchronizer will pick up 4th gear and speed it up to vehicle speed
                allowing a clash free shift. After the shift, re-engage the clutch while accelerating to keep the
                vehicle moving at the desired speed. If further downshifts are required, continue in the same manner.
            </para>
            <para>When downshifting, remember that 1st gear is not synchronized. Double clutching is required to
                complete a clash free shift. You can double clutch on all other shifts as well. This only aids the
                synchronizer in doing its job by manually helping to match the engine speed and road speed.
