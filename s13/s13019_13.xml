            <para>If the transmission fails to shift or shifts too slowly to or from the "split" position, the fault may
                be in the Splitter Shift Air System or related components of the Range Shift Air System.

            <para>To locate the trouble, the following checks should be made with normal vehicle air pressure supplied
                to the system, but with the engine off.
