        <para>Proper lubrication procedures are the key to a good all-around maintenance program.</para>
        <para>Eaton transmissions are designed so that the internal parts operate in an oil circulating bath created by
            the motion of the gears and shafts. Thus, all parts are amply lubricated if these procedures are closely
            followed:

        <step1>
            <para count="1">Maintain oil level. Inspect regularly.</para>
            <para>Make sure oil is level with the filler opening (
                <hotlnk xrefid="f13020s1">Figure 281</hotlnk>). Because you can reach oil with your finger does not mean
                oil is at proper level. (One inch of oil level is about one gallon of oil.)
