            <para>With the gear shift lever in neutral, check the breather of the air filter/regulator assembly. There
                should be NO AIR leaking from this port. The complete assembly should be replaced if a steady leak is
                found.

            <para>Cut off the vehicle air supply to the air filter/regulator assembly, disconnect the air line at the
                fitting in the Supply OUTLET and install an air gauge in the opened port. Bring the vehicle air pressure
                to normal. Regulated air pressure should be 57.5 to 62.5 PSI.

            <para>DO NOT ADJUST THE SCREW AT THE BOTTOM OF THE REGULATOR TO OBTAIN CORRECT READINGS. The air regulator
                has been PRE-ADJUSTED within the correct operating limits. Any deviation from these limits, especially
                with regulators that have been in operation for some time, is likely to be caused by dirt or worn parts.
                If replacement or cleaning of the filter element does nothing to correct the air pressure readings,
                replace the complete assembly, as the air regulator is non-serviceable.
