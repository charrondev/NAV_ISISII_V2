        <para>Leakage at the transmission pan-to-case gasket often can be stopped by tightening the retaining bolts to
            specification. Refer to Torque Specifications in this section. If necessary, install a new pan-to-case
            gasket only if gasket is damaged.
        </para>
        <para>If leakage is found by the solenoid body connector, refer to Solenoid Body Assembly in this section.
        </para>
        <para>When fluid is found to be leaking between the case and the cooler tube fitting, tighten the fitting to
            maximum specification. Refer to
            <hotlnk document="s13036_X3070260.xml" xrefid="x3070260">Transaxle/Transmission Cooling</hotlnk>.
        </para>
        <para>If the vehicle is equipped with power take-off (PTO), check the sealing gasket at the PTO unit for
            leaks.
        </para>
        <specpara>
            <caution>
                <para>Do not try to stop the fluid leak by increasing the torque beyond specification. This can cause
                    damage to the case threads and/or case fittings.
                </para>
            </caution>
        </specpara>
        <para>If the leak continues, install new cooler tube fitting and tighten to specification. The same procedure
            should be followed for fluid leaks between the oil-to-air cooler transmission remote filter, and the cooler
            tube fittings.
        </para>
        <para>If leakage is found at the manual control lever shaft, install a new seal.</para>
        <para>Check for fluid leaking from the end of the extension housing. Leakage can result from a damaged seal,
            missing garter spring, worn extension bushing, damaged speed sensor plug or the output shaft retainer
            (vehicles equipped with a fixed yoke). Install a new seal assembly, bushing or both, as necessary.
        </para>
        <para>Inspect the line pressure plug for leakage. Make sure it is tightened to specification. Refer to Torque
            Specifications in this section. If tightening the plug does not stop the leak, the case threads and/or plug
            could be damaged. Remove the plug and inspect the plug and case thread for damage. Repair as necessary.

            <emph type="bold">Fluid Leakage in Torque Converter Area</emph>
        </para>
        <para>In diagnosing and correcting fluid leaks in the front pump assembly and torque converter area, use the
            following procedures to locate the exact cause of the leakage. Leakage at the front of the transmission, as
            evidenced by fluid around the torque converter housing, may have several sources. By careful observation it
            is possible, in many instances, to pinpoint the source of the leak before removing the transmission from the
            vehicle. The paths which the fluid takes to reach the bottom of the torque converter housing are shown in
            the illustration. The following 5 steps correspond with the numbers in the illustration.

                the inside of the torque converter housing.
