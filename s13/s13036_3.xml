            <title>Shift Patterns</title>
            <para>The vehicle is equipped with adaptive shift strategy. Whenever the battery has been disconnected for
                any type of service or repair, the strategy parameters stored in keep alive memory (KAM) will be lost.
                The strategy will start or relearn once the battery is reconnected and the vehicle is driven. This is a
                temporary condition and normal operating mode will be resumed once the transmission control module (TCM)
                relearns all the parameters from the driving conditions. There is no set time frame for this process.
            </para>
            <para>The customer must be notified that they may experience slightly firm upshifts, delayed or early
                shifts. This operation is considered normal and will not affect the function or durability of the
                transmission. As the TCM relearns its adaptive strategy, this temporary condition will be replaced by a
                normal operating condition.
            </para>
            <para>The transmission upshifts and downshifts are firmer with tow/haul ON than when tow/haul is off.</para>

            </para>
            <para>Transmission upshifting is controlled by the TCM. The TCM receives inputs from various engine or

                (TCC) operation.

                <emph type="bold">Downshifts</emph>
            </para>
            <para>Under certain conditions, the transmission will downshift automatically to a lower gear range (without
                moving the transmission range selector lever). There are 4 categories of automatic downshifts;
                Coastdown, Torque Demand, Forced or Kickdown shifts and grade braking.

            </para>
            <para>The torque demand downshift occurs (automatically) during part throttle acceleration, when the demand
                for torque is greater than the engine can provide at that gear ratio.

            <para>
                <emph type="bold">Kickdown</emph>
            </para>
            <para>For maximum acceleration, the driver can force a downshift by pressing the accelerator pedal to the
                floor. A forced downshift into a lower gear is possible below calibrated speeds. Specifications for
                downshift speeds are subject to variations due to tire size, engine and transmission calibration
                requirements.

                increase the level of engine braking, particularly on down grades.
            </para>
            <para>Some of these vehicles may be equipped with a PTO. During stationary operation in PARK or NEUTRAL, the
                torque converter is locked up when the PTO is on, line pressure is set to 1,034 kPa (150 psi) and the
                engine operates at 1200 rpm.

            <para>The OD clutch piston has bonded lip seals. It is installed into the piston bore, cast into the pump
                and held in place by the return spring. The return spring is attached to the pump with 3 bolts. The OD
                clutch separator plates and pressure plate are splined to the case. The 3 OD friction plates are splined
                to the coast clutch cylinder. The OD clutch assembly is positioned between the pump face and a snap
                ring, and installed into the case adjacent to the OD pressure plate. The OD sun gear is pressed into the
                coast clutch cylinder.
            </para>
            <para>The coast clutch piston is also a bonded lip seal type. The coast clutch piston is installed into the
                coast clutch cylinder and held to the cylinder along with the clutch return spring by a snap ring. The
                separator plates are splined to the case.
            </para>
            <para>The coast clutch pressure plate is a mechanical diode one-way clutch (OWC) assembly. The OWC is
                splined to the coast clutch cylinder and held in with a snap ring. The coast clutch friction plates are
                internally splined to the coast clutch hub, which is held to the OD carrier by 4 bolts. Absorbing the
                load between the OD carrier and the OD sun gear is the "captured" thrust bearing, part of the OD planet
                assembly.
            </para>
            <para>On the opposite side of the OD planet is a thrust bearing positioned between the carrier and the
                shaft. The OD ring gear is splined to the center shaft and retained by a snap ring. On the opposite side
                of the center shaft is a thrust bearing that separates it from the center support. The overdrive/coast
                clutch system is driven clockwise by the input shaft, one end of which is splined to the torque
                converter cover and the other end is splined to the OD carrier.

            <para>The center support is rigidly held to the case by a tapered snap ring. The flat side faces toward the
                center support and the gap at 6 o'clock. The center support is also retained to the case by 2 hollow
                feed bolts. Both the forward clutch feed bolt and the intermediate clutch feed bolt are installed
                through the solenoid body worm trail of the case. The forward feed bolt has an orifice plug installed on
                top of the bolt head.
            </para>
            <para>The center support acts as the intermediate clutch cylinder piston bore, and also provides the snap
                ring groove to retain the bonded seal type intermediate clutch piston and the return spring. A black
                phenolic thrust washer is positioned by its 2 tabs into 2 holes in the center support. A seal pack
                containing 2 Teflon&#174; seals is pressed onto the center support hub below a pressed-on steel sleeve.
                The sleeve acts as the journal for the direct clutch cylinder bushings.
            </para>
            <para>The intermediate clutch separator plates and pressure plate are externally splined to the case and the

                shift scheduling and TCC operation. Failure of this sensor will cause the transmission to operate at
                higher line pressure to avoid damage to the transmission. This higher line pressure causes harsh
