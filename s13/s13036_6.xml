        <para>In order to diagnose a concern correctly, you must first understand the customer complaint or condition.
            Customer contact may be required in order for the technician to begin to verify the concern. You must also
            understand the conditions when the concern occurs, for example:

                <para>Some transmission conditions can cause engine concerns. An electronic pressure control short

        <para>A fluid level that is too high may cause the fluid to become aerated due to the churning action of the

            and possible transmission malfunction or damage. If an overfill reading is indicated, refer to Transmission

        <para>The 5R110 transmission is equipped with a remote transmission fluid filter which is located on the driver
            side rear of the transmission. Most of the transmission fluid which leaves the front fluid cooler tube
            connector passes through the remote filter and is directed into the cooling circuit. The remote filter takes
            10 percent of the incoming hot fluid and directs it through a small orifice and into a serviceable filter
            element. The filtered transmission fluid is then directed back into the rear lubrication circuit through the
            larger opening in the remote filter manifold. For additional information, refer to Transmission Fluid Cooler
