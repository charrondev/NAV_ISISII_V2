        <para>A retaining bolt and washers are useful to keep the NoSPIN differential assembly intact when removing it
            from the differential case and when re-installing it in the axle housing.

            <warning>
                <para>Failure to use a retaining bolt or some other restraining means when separating the differential
                    case halves can cause injury in that NoSPIN differentials have compressed springs.
                </para>

        <para>The bolt, washers and wing nut used to retain the NoSPIN differential assembly when it was shipped from
            the factory, as illustrated in
            <hotlnk xrefid="f1400301">Figure 1</hotlnk>, are best for this purpose. You will note that the retaining
            washers must be small enough to pass through the case ends (Dimension "A,"
            <hotlnk xrefid="f1400301">Figure 1</hotlnk>), yet large enough to restrain the two side gears (Dimension
            "B,"
            <hotlnk xrefid="f1400301">Figure 1</hotlnk>) and the balance of the NoSPIN differential assembly when all
            parts are assembled and the springs are compressed.
