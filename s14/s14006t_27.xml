                <para>This procedure applies to some 160 Series single rear axles and rear rear tandem axles. These
                    axles may also use a one-piece spigot bearing with a snap ring retainer.

                <para>The inner race of two-piece spigot bearings must be staked in place on RS series rear axles.
                    Before you stake the pinion, you must heat the pinion stem to soften it.

            <para count="1">Put the staking tool over the bearing race. Cut a one-inch piece from the green plastigage
                strip and put in between the punch and the staking tool (
                <hotlnk xrefid="f1400664">Figure 64</hotlnk>
                - View A). Hit the punch with a two-three pound brass hammer to upset the end of the pinion stem. Then,
                remove the strip and measure its thickness against the gauge on the wrapper that the strip came in. The
                strip must not be less than 0.003 inch thick. This thickness indicates that you are using enough force
                when you hit the punch. If the strip is too thin, then you must hit the punch harder so the stake will
                hold the race in place. Rotate the tool and repeat this procedure until there are six evenly spaced
                stake marks around the stem (
