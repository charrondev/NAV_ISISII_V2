                <hotlnk xrefid="f1400772">Figure 72</hotlnk>. If the contact pattern still does not conform, less
                backlash than normal is required. To avoid reducing differential bearing preload excessively, further
                loosening of the right hand adjusting ring should be accompanied by equal tightening of the left hand
                adjusting ring. Decreasing backlash moves the ring gear toward the pinion.

                backlash, tighten the right side adjusting ring further until the measured backlash is within
                specification. The tooth contact pattern should now spread more across the ring gear tooth as in

                <hotlnk xrefid="f1400772">Figure 72</hotlnk>. This is accomplished by choosing a thicker pinion position
                cage shim. Re-adjust pinion-to-ring gear backlash, as required, once proper pinion mounting distance has
                been established.
