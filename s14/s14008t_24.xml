                in Step 5, under DIFFERENTIAL. To reduce backlash, loosen the right side adjusting ring until the
                measured backlash is within specification. The tooth contact pattern should now have the same general
                shape and location as shown in
                <hotlnk xrefid="f1400866">Figure 66</hotlnk>. If the contact pattern still does not conform, less
                backlash than normal is required. To avoid reducing differential bearing preload excessively, further
                loosening of the right hand adjusting ring should be accompanied by equal tightening of the left hand
                adjusting ring. Decreasing backlash moves the ring gear toward the pinion.

                increase backlash, tighten the right side adjusting ring further until the measured backlash is within
                specification. The tooth contact pattern should now spread more across the ring gear tooth as in

                <hotlnk xrefid="f1400869">Figure 69</hotlnk>, the pinion is too close to the ring gear. It must be moved
                out and away to establish its proper mounting distance and contact pattern as shown in
                <hotlnk xrefid="f1400866">Figure 66</hotlnk>. This is accomplished by choosing a thicker pinion position
                cage shim. Re-adjust pinion-to-ring gear backlash, as required, once proper pinion mounting distance has
                been established.
