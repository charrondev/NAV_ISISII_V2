            <para>This system provides the option of operating with the Controlled Traction Differential engaged or
                disengaged with the use of an in-cab mounted pneumatic selector valve.
            </para>
            <para>
                <emph type="bold">Engagement.</emph>
                When the selector valve lever is moved to the engaged position, the selector valve is opened and air
                pressure is applied to the shift unit. The shift unit is connected to a shift fork and sliding clutch.
                The sliding clutch moves to engage the Controlled Traction Differential. In the engaged position, the
                wheel differential acts as a biasing differential.
            </para>
            <para>
                <emph type="bold">Disengagement.</emph>
                When the selector valve lever is moved to the disengaged position, the selector valve is closed. Air
                pressure in the shift unit is exhausted. The sliding clutch retracts and disengages the Controlled
                Traction Differential. In the disengaged position, the wheel differential functions with conventional
                differential action.

            <para>A simple method for quickly locating trouble in a shift system can be accomplished by listening for
                possible air leaks and for sound (or feel by hand) which would indicate mechanical shifting.

                    the wheel and the drive shaft should rotate. If the wheel rotates, go to Step 6. If wheel will not
