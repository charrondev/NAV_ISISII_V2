            <para>The CTD shift system provides the option of operation with the Controlled Traction Differential
                engaged or disengaged with the use of an in-cab pneumatic valve.
            </para>
            <para>Two shift units (one on each axle) engage or disengage the Controlled Traction Differentials. A quick
                release valve in the system provides fast release of air pressure from the shift units.
            </para>
            <para>There are two types of CTD shift systems for tandem axles (
                <hotlnk xrefid="f1401043">Figure 43</hotlnk>): (1) a one-selector valve system controlling operation of
                the inter-axle differential and both controlled traction differentials, or (2) a two-selector valve
                system which offers independent control of the inter-axle differential and the controlled traction
                differentials.

                <emph type="bold">Engagement.</emph>
                When the selector valve lever is moved to the engaged position, the selector valve is opened and air
                pressure is applied to the shift unit (or units). Each shift unit is connected to a shift fork and
                sliding clutch. The sliding clutch moves to engage the controlled traction differential. In the engaged
                position, the wheel differential acts as a biasing differential.
            </para>
            <para>
                <emph type="bold">In the one-selector valve system,</emph>
                the CTD and inter-axle differential are controlled by one valve and both are engaged when the selector
                valve is in the engaged position.

            <para>
                <emph type="bold">Disengagement.</emph>
                When the selector valve lever is moved to the disengaged position, the selector valve is closed. Air
                pressure in the shift unit (or units) is exhausted. The sliding clutch retracts and disengages the
                controlled traction differential. In the disengaged position, the wheel differential functions with
                conventional differential action.
