                <emph type="bold">Engaging-</emph>To engage, remove the shift fork cover retainer and adjusting screw
                assembly. Push the protruding end of the shift fork away from the carrier. If the shift fork will not
                move, lift both wheels off the ground (leave vehicle transmission in gear and release parking brake).
                While pushing on the shift fork, rotate the wheel on the shift fork side of the carrier very slowly. The
                shift fork should now be in the engaged position.
            </para>
            <para>To reassemble cover retainer, the adjusting screw must be backed out several turns. This is done so
                that the shift fork cover retainer bolt holes align with the studs on the carrier. Once the shift fork
                cover retainer is in place (adjusting screw facing carrier), tighten the shift fork cover retainer nuts
                to 55 to 61 ft-lbs. (74 to 82 N&#8226;m). Now turn the adjusting screw in until it contacts the shift
                fork. While holding the adjusting screw with a wrench, tighten the locknut to 30 to 40 ft-lbs. (41 to 54
                N&#8226;m).
