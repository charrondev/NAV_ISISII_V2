            <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
            <para>The Eaton wheel differential lock is an optional feature for Eaton axles. In operation, it positively
                locks the wheel differential to provide improved traction under adverse road conditions.
            </para>
            <para>The differential lock is driver-controlled through an electric switch or air valve mounted in the cab.
                The locking mechanism is air-operated to engage a mechanical clutch and lock the wheel differential. It
                is spring-operated to disengage the lock and permit the wheel differential to function normally.
            </para>
            <para>The wheel differential lock consists of three major assemblies (
