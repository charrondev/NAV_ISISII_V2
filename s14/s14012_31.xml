                    <para>In cases where wheel equipment is being installed, either new or after maintenance activity,
                        the lube cavities are empty. Bearings and seals must be manually supplied with adequate
                        lubricant or they will be severely damaged before the normal motion of the vehicle can supply
                        lube to the hub ends of the housing (
                        <hotlnk xrefid="f1401273">Figure 73</hotlnk>).

            <para>To avoid the risk of premature damage to wheel bearings and seals, they must be "prelubed" any time
                the wheel equipment is being installed. There are two methods of doing this. The correct method will
                depend on the type of wheel equipment being used.

                        <para>If the hub has no cavity to accept a precharge of axle lube, the bearings can be prepacked
                            with a good quality grease instead of axle lube. However, excess grease should be removed.
