        <title>PINION ABOVE CENTER APPLICATIONS</title>
        <para>The D135-S, F155-S, and F170-S axle assemblies may be specified for pinion above center applications, such
            as motor homes, buses, or other rear engine chassis vehicles.
        </para>
        <para>The following modifications to the carrier assemblies have been made to insure proper lubrication when the
            axle assembly is mounted with the pinion above center.
        </para>
        <para>Changes to the D135-S, for above center applications, are the addition of an oil scoop (
            <hotlnk xrefid="f1401405">Figure 5</hotlnk>), and an additional oil passage in the pinion bearing cage. The
            mounting screw for the oil scoop must be cleaned and coated with #271 Loctite or equivalent. Refer to GROUP
            10 - LUBRICANTS AND SEALERS in the CTS-5000 Master Service Manual.

            GROUP 10 - LUBRICANTS AND SEALERS in the CTS-5000 Master Service Manual. The 3/8 inch oil scoop mounting
            bolts must be tightened to 34 to 38 ft-lbs. (46 to 51 N&#8226;m).
