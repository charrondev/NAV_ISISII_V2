            <title>AIR SUPPLY</title>
            <para>The air supply for the lift axle assembly is provided by the supply (wet) tank mounted either under or
                near the cab. Air from this tank is routed to an axle mounted tank which increases the capacity of the
                air system to compensate for the air used to operate the lift axle systems (brakes, load bags, and lift
                bags). The lift axle suspension and control systems are connected to the axle tank through a Pressure
                Protection Valve (PPV). This valve provides air to the suspension system only if the tank pressure is
                above a predetermined level. The valve opens once the supply tank pressure is
                <emph type="underscr">></emph>
                80 psi, and remains open as long as the tank pressure is
                <emph type="underscr">></emph>
                70 psi. This prevents loss of pressure in the main air system if a leak should develop in the suspension
                system.

            <title>ENABLING THE LIFT AXLE SYSTEM</title>
            <specpara>
                <warning>
                    <para>To avoid property damage, personal injury, or possible death; set all UP/DOWN switches to the
                        UP position before enabling the system (pressing the AXLE ENABLE switch). If any axle UP/DOWN
                        switch is in the DOWN position when the ignition is switched off, the axle controlled by that
                        switch will automatically raise to its up position. Enabling the lift axle system with an axle
                        UP/DOWN switch in the DOWN position will cause that axle to be immediately lowered. The position
                        of the UP/DOWN switches should be checked carefully because the DOWN indicators on the switches
                        are always unlit (in either switch position) until the system is enabled.
                    </para>
                </warning>
            </specpara>
            <specpara>
                <note>
                    <para>It is good practice to place all axle UP/DOWN switches to the UP position before enabling the
                        system.
                    </para>
                </note>
            </specpara>
            <para>To enable the suspension system, turn the vehicle ignition on and press the AXLE ENABLE switch. This
                will apply power to the axle UP/DOWN switches and light the indicator on the AXLE ENABLE switch.

            <title>LOWERING THE LIFT AXLE</title>
            <para>With the lift axle system enabled, set the corresponding axle UP/DOWN switch to the DOWN position.
                This will turn on the indicator in that switch and send an electrical signal to energize the solenoid
                mounted on the lift axle. When the solenoid is energized, the air pressure is removed from the Quick
                Release Valves (QRVs) in the lift bag lines. This causes the QRVs to vent the air in the lift bags to
                the atmosphere. As air is vented from the lift bags the axle assembly will lower. The solenoid will now
                route the pressurized air from the tank to the input of the pressure regulator in the cab. The regulator
                is used to control the amount of air pressure used to inflate the load bags. The air is routed from the
                tank, through the PPV, the solenoid, the regulator, and another QRV to the load bags. The amount of load
                bag air pressure required to provide a given axle load capacity varies according to the run height of
                the axle (

                    <para>The air pressure values indicated in the Load Pressure Tables are APPROXIMATE. To obtain an
                        accurate load vs. air pressure reading it is necessary to calibrate the unit over a flat and
                        accurate scale.

            <title>RAISING THE LIFT AXLE</title>
            <para>To raise an axle, set the axle UP/DOWN switch to the UP position. This will turn off the indicator in
                that switch and remove power from the solenoid mounted on the lift axle. When the solenoid is
                de-energized, the air pressure is removed from the QRV in the load bag line. This causes the QRV and
                solenoid to vent the air in the load bags to the atmosphere. The solenoid will now route the pressurized
                air from the tank to the lift bags. The air is routed from the tank, through the PPV, the solenoid, and
                the lift bag QRVs to the lift bags. The expanding lift bags pivot the swingarm, raising the axle to its
                up position.

            <specpara>
                <warning>
                    <para>To avoid property damage, personal injury, or possible death; set all UP/DOWN switches to the
                        UP position before enabling the system (pressing the AXLE ENABLE switch). If any axle UP/DOWN
                        switch is in the DOWN position when the ignition is switched off, the axle controlled by that
                        switch will automatically raise to its up position. Enabling the lift axle system with an axle
                        UP/DOWN switch in the DOWN position will cause that axle to be immediately lowered. The position
                        of the UP/DOWN switches should be checked carefully because the DOWN indicators on the switches
                        are always unlit (in either switch position) until the system is enabled.

                    <para>It is good practice to place all axle UP/DOWN switches to the UP position before disabling the

            <para>Disable the system by switching the vehicle ignition off. This removes power from the system. The
                indicators in the AXLE ENABLE and axle UP/DOWN switches will turn off and power will be removed from the
                lift axle solenoid. If the lift axle is in the lowered position when the ignition is switched off, the
                solenoid and QRV will vent the air from the load bags to the atmosphere. The de-energized solenoid will
                now route the pressurized air from the tank to the lift bags. The air is routed from the tank, through
                the PPV, the solenoid, and the QRVs to the lift bags. The expanding lift bags pivot the swingarm,
                raising the axle to its up position. Once the ignition has been turned off, the lift axle system can be
                enabled only by switching the ignition on
                <emph type="bold">AND</emph>
                pressing the AXLE ENABLE switch.
