            <title>AIR SUPPLY</title>
            <para>The air supply for the lift axle assembly is provided by the supply (wet) tank mounted either under or
                near the cab. Air from this tank is routed to an axle mounted tank which increases the capacity of the
                air system to compensate for the air used to operate the lift axle systems (brakes, load bags, and lift
                bags). The lift axle suspension and control systems are connected to the axle tank through a Pressure
                Protection Valve (PPV). This valve provides air to the suspension system only if the tank pressure is
                above a predetermined level. The valve opens once the supply tank pressure is
                <emph type="underscr">></emph>
                80 psi, and remains open as long as the tank pressure is
                <emph type="underscr">></emph>
                70 psi. This prevents loss of pressure in the main air system if a leak should develop in the suspension
                system.

            <title>ENABLING THE LIFT AXLE SYSTEM</title>
            <specpara>
                <warning>
                    <para>To avoid property damage, personal injury, or possible death; set all UP/DOWN switches to the
                        UP position before enabling the system (pressing the AXLE ENABLE switch). If any axle UP/DOWN
                        switch is in the DOWN position when the ignition is switched off, the axle controlled by that
                        switch will automatically raise to its up position. Enabling the lift axle system with an axle
                        UP/DOWN switch in the DOWN position will cause that axle to be immediately lowered. The position
                        of the UP/DOWN switches should be checked carefully because the DOWN indicators on the switches
                        are always unlit (in either switch position) until the system is enabled.

                    <para>It is good practice to place all axle UP/DOWN switches to the UP position before enabling the
                        system.

            </specpara>
            <para>To enable the lift axle suspension system, turn the vehicle ignition on and press the AXLE ENABLE
                switch. This will apply power to the axle UP/DOWN switches and turn on the indicator on the AXLE ENABLE
                switch.

            <title>LOWERING THE LIFT AXLE</title>
            <para>To lower an axle, set the corresponding axle UP/DOWN switch to the DOWN position. This will turn on
                the indicator in that switch and send an electrical signal to energize the solenoid mounted on the lift
                axle. When the solenoid is energized, the air pressure is removed from the Quick Release Valves (QRVs)
                in the lift bag lines. This causes the QRVs and solenoid to vent the air in the lift bags to the
                atmosphere. As air is vented from the lift bags the axle assembly will lower. The solenoid will now
                route the pressurized air from the tank to the input of the pressure regulator in the cab. The regulator
                is used to control the amount of air pressure used to inflate the load bags. The air is routed from the
                tank, through the PPV, the solenoid, the regulator, and another QRV to the load bags. The amount of load
                bag air pressure required to provide a given axle load capacity varies according to the run height of
                the axle (

                    <para>The air pressure values indicated in the Load Pressure Tables are approximate. To obtain an
                        accurate load vs. air pressure reading it is necessary to calibrate the unit over a flat and
                        accurate scale.

            <title>RAISING THE LIFT AXLE</title>
            <para>To raise an axle, set the axle UP/DOWN switch to the UP position. This will turn off the indicator in
                that switch and remove power from the solenoid mounted on the corresponding lift axle. When the solenoid
                is de-energized, the air pressure is removed from the QRV in the load bag line. This causes the QRV and
                solenoid to vent the air in the load bags to the atmosphere. The solenoid will now route the pressurized
                air from the tank to the lift bags. The air is routed from the tank, through the PPV, the solenoid, and
                the lift bag QRVs to the lift bags. The expanding lift bags pivot the swingarm, raising the axle to its
                up position.

                        of the UP/DOWN switches should be checked carefully because the DOWN indicators on the switches
                        are always unlit (in either switch position) until the system is enabled.

            <para>On vehicles with self-steer lift axles, all lowered lift axles will automatically be raised to the up

                of the lift axle switches. This also removes power from the lift axle solenoid(s). If any axle is in the

                lowered to its down position.
