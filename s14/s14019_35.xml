        <para>In this configuration the AXLE ENABLE switch, the Lift Axle Up/Down switch and a Pressure Regulator Gauge
            are located on the floor mounted pedestal next to the driver's seat. The Pressure Regulator and a second
            Pressure Gauge are located on an external control panel located at the rear of the cab (
            <hotlnk xrefid="f14019z">FIGURE 26</hotlnk>). This arrangement allows the load air spring pressure to be set
            from outside of the cab, while still allowing the control switches and Pressure Gauge to be accessible from
            the driver's seat.

                <para>On trucks with multiple lift axles the controls are located as follows. The controls for the lift
                    axle closest to the front of the truck are located closest to the top of the pedestal and closest to
                    the left on the rear control panel. The controls for the lift axle furthest from the front of the
                    truck are located furthest from the top of the pedestal and furthest to the right on the rear
                    control panel.
