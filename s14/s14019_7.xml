            <para>The lift axle controls are available in two configurations. Either all of the controls are located
                inside the cab, or the controls are split between inside the cab and outside the cab. The same four
                controls are used in each of the configurations (

            <para>In this configuration all of the axle controls are located on a floor mounted pedestal next to the
                driver's seat. The controls accessible from the driver's seat are the AXLE ENABLE switch, the Lift Axle
                UP/DOWN switch, the Pressure Regulator and the Pressure Gauge (

            <para>In this configuration the AXLE ENABLE switch, the Lift Axle UP/DOWN switch and a Pressure Gauge are
                located on a floor mounted pedestal next to the driver's seat. The Pressure Regulator and a second
                Pressure Gauge are located on an external panel located at the rear of the cab (
                <hotlnk xrefid="f14019k">FIGURE 6</hotlnk>). This arrangement allows the load air spring pressure to be
                set from outside of the cab, while still allowing the control switches and Pressure Gauge to be
                accessible from the driver's seat. For a more detailed description of the mixed controls, refer to the
