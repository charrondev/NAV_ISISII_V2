            <para count="1">Major repairs should be done in a well equipped repair shop. Pulling devices, air tools,
                proper riveting equipment and a welding machine will be necessary to do a good job.

        <step1>
            <para count="1">For proper alignment, the cab should be set up on a flat surface. The cab in
                <hotlnk xrefid="f1600101">Figure 1</hotlnk>
                is resting on a simple, rolling dolly. it is helpful to be able to fasten the cab down at different
                points while making the repairs. Wood 4 x 4's can be used for support. Having the cab at a good height
                for working will speed up the job.

            <para count="1">Take measurements before making any repairs. These measurements will give you a good idea of
                what needs to be done.

            <para count="1">Try to square the cab up with some pulls. if you need to, remove some sections to do this,
                but take out as few as possible. The more straightening you can do with everything still in place, the
                better.

        </step1>
        <step1>
            <para count="1">The engine tunnel is the most critical section of this cab. The shape of the tunnel allows
                it to clear the engine properly. If it is not returned to the original shape, it will not do this. if it
                is too badly damaged to be straightened in place, it must be replaced.
                <hotlnk xrefid="f1600103">Figure 3</hotlnk>
                shows a tunnel with a large fold in its top. This tunnel had to be replaced. Replacing a tunnel will
                require removal of the dashboards and the bunk floors so as to get at the horse collars.

            <para count="1">Damage to the right or left rear corner (common in jackknife accidents) may be repaired by
                splicing in a new section of the outer sill.

                shows the splice in place. This splice was welded and backed up by an aluminum plate. You can see the
                huck bolts used to hold the plate in place.

                shows removal of the entire right floor and all the side and front panels on the right side. The tunnel
                on this cab was heavily damaged and it was also removed.

            <para count="1">Whenever you remove sections for repair or replacement, it is important to brace the rest of
                the cab so that it will hold its shape. In

                you can see that the roof is held up by a post, and there is a diagonal pulley for further support.
