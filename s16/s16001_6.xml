        <title>REPAIRING CO-9670 CABS</title>
        <para>In order to develop the preceding major structural repair instructions we did the actual work on two
            damaged CO 9670 cabs. The following photographs show this process. Both cabs were damaged as the result of
            jackknife accidents. Cab A was damaged badly enough so that the engine tunnel had to be removed and
            replaced. Cab B suffered less extensive damage and was repaired without removing the tunnel. The work was
            done in a commercial body shop by two regular employees. Neither of them had any special training in the
            repair of these cabs. Neither of them had worked on a CO 9670 cab before. According to both men, the
            construction and design of these cabs made their jobs very easy. Neither one encountered any difficulties.
        </para>

            <hotlnk xrefid="f1600110">CAB A. Figure 10:</hotlnk>
            This cab was badly damaged on the right rear corner. The force of the blow also buckled the engine tunnel
            and caused minor damage to other structures as well. It was necessary to remove the tunnel to properly
            repair this cab. To show how extensive damage can be easily repaired, the whole right floor assembly was
            also removed. Normally, the damage could have been repaired by splicing on a new right rear outer sill
            section and some new flooring

            This cab was hit more in the rear. The rear horse collar and the right rear outer sill were damaged. The
            impact caused some distortion of the tunnel and some minor damage to other structures. It was decided that
            this cab could be repaired without removing the tunnel. This proved to be true.

            With the side and rear panels removed, the interior damage to the right rear corner can be seen. The force
            of the blow carried across the cab causing the tunnel to buckle. The left "B" pillar was damaged and the
            driver's door was sprung outward.

            With the rear panel removed, you can see how the force of the blow bent the horse collar out of shape. The
            right rear outer sill was also bent. The force of the blow caused minor damage at other places in the cab,
            but most of the damage was located in the rear. The tunnel on this cab did not have to be replaced.

            could be removed from the front horse collar.

            With only the back and right quarter panels removed, a pulling bar is set up to straighten the cab as much
            as possible. The bar is placed along the direction of the impact. The forward end of the pull is fastened to
            a plate that is attached to the bolts that hold the left front pivot.

            After the back and right rear quarter panels were removed, the tunnel was disassembled. The damaged right
            floor could have been repaired by splicing on a new section of outer sill and floor panel. It was decided to
            drop the whole floor in order to see if this made the repair more difficult. It did not cause any problems.
            The picture shows the floor being separated from the horse collar. Note the roof support and the pull that
            help hold the cab's shape.

            This picture shows the other end of the pulling bar. It has been attached to the upper right corner of the
            rear horse collar. A jack has been placed to keep the lower corners of the horse collar the correct distance
            apart. Another pull (not visible) runs on the opposite diagonal to the pulling bar. The two pulls and the
            jack were tensioned until the diagonal underbody dimensions were correct. With everything still in tension,
            the tunnel was hammered back into shape.

            Once the tunnel d been hammered into shape, the rear horse collar was dropped out. You can see that the rear
            end of the tunnel has taken its correct shape. A jack and a pull hold the rear end of the tunnel in place.
            Note that the driver's door is sprung out. The top of the cab sprung to the left, then snapped back to the
            right. Another set of pulls will be used to realign it.

            Here is the new floor panel welded to the repaired floor. Although care was taken to prevent heat build up,
