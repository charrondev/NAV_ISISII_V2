        <title>ORIGINAL FINISH RESTORATION</title>
        <svcsubsecinfo>
            <para>In many cases repair of the finish does not have to include repainting. To reduce customer complaints,
                original finish and final detailing may be necessary. The four main steps to finish restoration are
                filing and sanding, buffing, polishing, and protecting the finish.
            </para>
            <para>Before any finish restoration, wash the vehicle to remove foreign material.</para>

            <title>FILING AND SANDING</title>
            <para>Filing and sanding removes dirt nibs, runs, and sags. A file, sanding stone, or block should be used
                to remove the defect. Normally, using sandpaper to remove a defect causes the area to crown. This means
                that the paint surface around the defect wears away before the defect. Using a file, stone, or block,
                the defect can be removed without excessive damage to the surrounding paint. To make a dirt nib file,
                refer to
