        <svcsubsecinfo>
            <para>Getting a good cab door to door opening fit requires a knowledge of where the various adjustments are
                located and what effect each adjustment has on door fit. These adjustments apply whether door has been
                removed or door adjustment is simply being changed or improved.
            </para>
            <para>When the door is properly adjusted, it should fit the opening with 1/4 to 5/16 inch (6 to 8 mm) space
                all around the door frame. A newspaper sheet should not be able to pass between the weather seal and
                door frame (paper should tear).
