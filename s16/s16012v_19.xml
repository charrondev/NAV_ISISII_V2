        <para>The Deluxe Recovery/Recycling Station (OEM-1380 for R-12 or OEM-1418 for HFC-134A) is a continuous loop
            recycling system in which the refrigerant is recycled until all the moisture and contaminants are removed (
            <hotlnk xrefid="f1601221">Figure 21</hotlnk>). The system recovers 1/2 lb. of refrigerant per minute and
            recycles 2-1/2 lbs. per minute.

        <para>The unit is programmed and operates through your manifold gauge set or charging station with a single
            connection hook-up. It is designed to automatically shut off on the recovery cycle and purge air from
            storage tanks to prevent pressure build up. A moisture indicator will change from yellow to green when
            recycling is complete.
        </para>
        <para>Components include a heavy-duty, hermetically sealed compressor, maintenance-free oil separator/heat
            exchanger with calibrated waste oil bottle, 300-lb.-capacity refrigerant filter, three 72" color-coded
            "quick seal" hoses for R-12 systems, Metric SAE quick-disconnect fittings (with valves) for HFC-134A
            systems, and two 30-lb.-capacity, D.O.T. approved, reusable storage tanks.
