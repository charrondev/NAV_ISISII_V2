        <para>The set of three color-coded, 60-inch (152 mm) evacuating and charging hoses (
            <hotlnk xrefid="f1601224">Figure 24</hotlnk>) are supplied with the manifold and gauge set. A 20-foot (508
            mm) set is available as an option. Both feature neoprene coating and "Quick-Seal" couplings for R-12 systems
            and Metric SAE quick-disconnect fittings (with valves) for HFC-134A systems.

        <para>The manifold gauge set and service hoses MUST BE DEDICATED to and used only on one of the two types of
            refrigerant. If the oil that is in the hoses and gauges used to service an R-12 charged air conditioning
            systems is introduced into an HFC-134A charged air conditioning system, the oil from the R-12 manifold gauge
            set and hoses will cause the HFC-134A system to function poorly and eventually may cause compressor failure.
            The same thing will happen if HFC-134A oil is introduced into an R-12 system.
