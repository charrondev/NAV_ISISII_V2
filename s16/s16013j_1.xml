                    <para>The functions of the compressor are to push the refrigerant through the air conditioning
                        system, and compress and superheat the heat-saturated refrigerant returned from the evaporator.

                        plate and base plate are die cast aluminum. The crankshaft is cast iron as are the cylinder
                        liners, which are permanently cast into the crankcase.

                        <para>The compressor is driven by the vehicle engine and operates on demand by the air
                            conditioning system through the magnetic clutch. During the down stroke a slight vacuum is
                            created between the top of the piston and the cylinder head causing the inlet valve to open.
                            Refrigerant at a pressure of 12 to 50 psi is drawn into the cylinder. As the piston begins
                            its upward stroke, the refrigerant that was drawn into the cylinder on the down stroke is
                            being compressed. Pressure on the inlet valve allows it to close. The piston continues its
                            upward stroke and refrigerant now compressed to 120-300 psi pushes the outlet valve open.
                            Refrigerant flows through the open valve into the air conditioning system.

                        <para>During operation, electrical current flows into the field coil. The energized field coil,
                            acting as an electromagnet, holds the clutch plate in contact with the pulley, setting the
                            compressor in motion. When the cab interior reaches the desired temperature, the field coil
                            is de-energized, the clutch plate is released from the pulley, and compressor operation
                            stops.
