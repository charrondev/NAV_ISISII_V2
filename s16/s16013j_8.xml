            <para>Replacement of the front and/or rear crankshaft bearing(s) requires complete disassembly of the
                compressor. Special care must be taken as many of the critical parts such as pistons, connecting rods,
                connecting rod bearings, etc. are not available as replacement parts. Normally the front and rear
                bearings are replaced at the same time since they may be damaged in the disassembly of the unit.

                            oil used in the system. The gaskets are made of fiber-neoprene composition and wicking
                            action will result as the oil follows the fiber. Wicking is normal and is to be expected.
