        <para>The evaporator core (
            <hotlnk xrefid="f1601506">Figure 6</hotlnk>) is mounted in the airflow, before the heater core. Low
            pressure/low temperature liquid refrigerant from the expansion valve enters the evaporator. Upon entering
            the evaporator, the pressure is immediately reduced, causing the refrigerant to change its state to a low
            pressure/low temperature vapor. Cooling and dehumidifying of the cab's interior takes place as the
            refrigerant vapor passes through the evaporator's finned tubes and absorbs heat from the cab air forced
            across the evaporator by the blower.
        </para>
        <para>The expansion valve is located at the inlet of the evaporator, and is the dividing line between the high
            pressure and low pressure sides of the A/C system. Attached to the top of the expansion valve is a capillary
            tube with a feeler bulb which is clamped to the outlet (suction) pipe of the evaporator. A second capillary
            tube (the equalizer line) is attached under the valve diaphragm and is connected to the evaporator outlet
            (suction) pipe. Together, the capillary tube and equalizer line regulate the amount of refrigerant entering
            the evaporator through the expansion valve. The valve decreases the amount of refrigerant entering the
            evaporator core when lower temperatures are sensed and increases the amount at higher temperatures.
