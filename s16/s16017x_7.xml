                <note>
                    <para>The seal can be replaced without compressor removal; however, the system must be discharged.

            </specpara>
            <para>The shaft seal assembly of the compressor is of a simplified design, yet tight sealing, long lasting
                and, when necessary, easily and quickly replaced.
            </para>
            <para>The tendency to condemn a seal assembly because of very slight leakage is an error that is often
                committed. Few if any mechanical seal assemblies are 100% tight. The rubbing surfaces of the seal are
                separated by a very fine film of oil.
            </para>
            <para>Oil carries refrigerant, and minute quantities which seep to the outside may be detected with ultra
                sensitive leak detectors, which are capable of sensing leakage totalling one ounce of refrigerant over a
                twenty year period. Such sensitivity serves a useful purpose in critical applications, but for leak
                testing compressor joints or seal, a leak detector should be calibrated to pick up those leaks which are
                in excess of one ounce per year. Since shaft seals depend upon oil for lubrication and sealing, it is
                quite natural to find oil in the shaft cavity.
            </para>
            <para>Do not be too prone to condemn and replace a seal assembly until the seal has been given an
                opportunity to "run in" and until there is definite proof that replacement is really necessary. Refer to
                GROUP 16 - A/C THEORY AND SYSTEM DIAGNOSIS AND SERVICE in the CTS-5000 Master Service Manual for more
                detailed leak detection procedures.
            </para>
            <para>If a refrigerant leak from the area behind the compressor clutch is verified with a refrigerant leak
                detector, replacement of the compressor shaft seal is recommended.
            </para>
            <specpara>
                <note>
                    <para>Up to a few drops of compressor oil may normally be found in the area under the front seal. Do
                        not replace a seal based on the presence of small amounts of oil. Verify a leak with a
                        refrigerant leak detector before replacement, then proceed as follows:
