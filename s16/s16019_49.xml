            <title>PRE-SEASON SERVICING</title>
            <para>Field experience has indicated that many of the problems incurred with heating and air conditioning
                systems are the result of lack of regular maintenance. Preventive maintenance and cleanliness of all
                components within the system are extremely important. A complete step-by-step pre-season checkout of the
                air conditioner/heater system will substantially increase satisfactory operation during the season.
