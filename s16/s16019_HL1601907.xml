                        model and year. The high pressure service port is located on the compressor's high pressure
                        discharge line between the compressor and the expansion valve. Typical locations are on the
                        receiver-dryer or on the compressor. The low pressure port is located on the compressor suction
                        line, between the expansion valve and the compressor.
