                <para>The locations of the A/C system high pressure and low pressure service ports vary by vehicle model
                    and year. The high pressure service port is located on the compressor's high pressure discharge line
                    between the compressor and the expansion valve. Typical locations are on the receiver-dryer or on
                    the compressor. The low pressure port is located on the compressor suction line, between the
                    expansion valve and the compressor.
                </para>
                <para>Discharge and suction ports are usually marked on the compressor head. If the marking is not
                    visible, you can identify the suction (low pressure) side by the larger diameter hose connected to
                    the compressor.
