            <para>There are several methods of refrigerant leak detection. The method used could depend on many factors
                including equipment availability, layout of the system being serviced, or even personal preference. The
                primary recommended methods are the electronic refrigerant leak detector and the phosphor
                dye/ultraviolet lamp method. In addition, brief descriptions are provided for two alternate methods
                (ultrasonic leak detection and soap solution). By using the described methods, either separately or in
                some combination, it should be possible to locate and verify most refrigerant leaks.

            <title>Electronic Refrigerant Leak Detectors</title>
            <para>In terms of sensitivity and safety, the electronic leak detector (
                <hotlnk xrefid="f1601948">Figure 50</hotlnk>) is excellent for finding both slow and major system leaks.
                Ensure that the detector being used is intended for use with R134a refrigerant. Many leak detectors
                intended for use with R-12 cannot detect R134a leaks. The detector is also listed in the

            <para>The unit is a hand-held device having a flexible probe used to seek out refrigerant leaks. An audio
                leak indicator signals a warning in the presence of a leak. It is important to become familiar with the
                leak detector instructions for the detector being used. The speed at which the probe is moved over the
                component being checked is very important in locating larger than permissible leaks. Leak check
                procedure should be in accordance with SAE J1628.
            </para>
            <para>Before starting to look for leaks, it is recommended to clean away all oil or grease, and blow away
                refrigerant residue from fittings and A/C components. All suspected areas should be cleaned using soap
                and water, not a solvent. A detected leak should be a flow of refrigerant, not a residual condition of
                refrigerant that is trapped under an oil film, etc. A detected leak rate in excess of 1.0 oz./year is
                unacceptable.

            <title>Ultraviolet Lamp Leak Testing</title>
            <para>An alternate method to electronic leak testing is ultraviolet light. A phosphor dye is added to the
                system and leaks are detected by the use of an ultraviolet (UV) lamp. When illuminated by the UV lamp,
                the phosphor dye will produce a bright yellow-green trace at the leak. It has been discovered during the
                use of ultraviolet light and the phosphor dye that other types of leaks may also appear as a
                yellow-green trace when the UV light shines on them. If phosphor dye is used for leak detection, it is
                recommended that an electronic leak detector also be used to verify that a detected leak is a
                refrigerant leak. Refer to
                <hotlnk xrefid="hl1601921">Electronic Leak Detectors</hotlnk>.
            </para>
            <para>Phosphor dye can be added to any system that is not already charged with it. The dye charging process
                should be performed according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer of the dye injector. The
                kit illustrated in
                <hotlnk xrefid="f1601949">Figure 51</hotlnk>
                provides the UV lamp used to illuminate the suspected leaks. The kit also contains connection hoses and
                a dye injector, as well as, eyeglasses used to enhance the effect of the UV light on the dye. After
                adding phosphor dye to an A/C system, the compressor or receiver-dryer should be labeled indicating that
                the system contains phosphor dye.

            <title>Ultrasonic Leak Detectors</title>
            <para>An ultrasonic leak detector listens for the distinctive 'sound' of a gas passing through an opening.
                To use this type of detector effectively, the refrigerant system is first discharged, and then
                pressurized to 300 psi using dry nitrogen and a manifold gauge set. Refer to
                <hotlnk xrefid="hl1601938">REFRIGERANT LEAK TESTING WITH NITROGEN</hotlnk>. The detector is then used to
                scan the suspected joints or components. Depending on the detector being used, a leak may be indicated
                by a visual or audible signal. Suspected leaks should not be cleaned with a soap solution prior to
                scanning with this tool, as any solution remaining at the leak site may mask the leak.

            <para>The unit is a hand-held device and may include attachments to vary the directional sensitivity of the
                unit. Because this type of sensor does not sample the gas used in the system, it may be used with any
                refrigerant system. It may also be used to detect leaks in the vehicle air system. It is important to
                become familiar with the leak detector instructions for the detector being used.

            <para>Another alternative method of leak detection is the soap solution method. To improve the results of
                this method the refrigerant system is first discharged, and then pressurized to 300 psi using dry
                nitrogen. Refer to
                <hotlnk xrefid="hl1601938">REFRIGERANT LEAK TESTING WITH NITROGEN</hotlnk>. A solution of soap and water
                is then sprayed on the suspected joints or components. A leak is indicated by bubbles forming at the
                point where the pressurized nitrogen is escaping.
