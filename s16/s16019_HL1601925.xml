                    <para>The locations of the A/C system high pressure and low pressure service ports vary by vehicle
                        model and year. The high pressure service port is located on the compressor's high pressure
                        discharge line between the compressor and the expansion valve. Typical locations are on the
                        receiver-dryer or on the compressor. The low pressure port is located on the compressor suction
                        line, between the expansion valve and the compressor.
                    </para>
                    <para>Discharge and suction ports are usually marked on the compressor head. If the marking is not
                        visible, you can identify the suction (low pressure) side by the larger diameter hose connected
                        to the compressor.
