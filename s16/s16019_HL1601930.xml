            <title>CHECKING OIL LEVEL IN CCI COMPRESSORS</title>
            <para>The oil level in CCI compressors can be checked with the compressor mounted in the vehicle or on the
                bench. Whether mounted in the vehicle, or sitting on the bench, the compressor oil level can be checked
                by using a specially-constructed dipstick (
                <hotlnk xrefid="f1601946">Figure 45</hotlnk>). When the compressor is mounted in the vertical position,
                the oil level may be checked from the right or left side (
                <hotlnk xrefid="f1601947">Figure 46</hotlnk>). When mounted in the horizontal position, the fill plug is
                on the top.

            <para>The quantity of oil contained in an uninstalled replacement compressor can be checked by the dipstick
                method or by draining it into a calibrated container.
