                        refrigerant into the atmosphere. Because of the absence of chlorine in the molecular structure
                        of R-134a, the use of R-134a refrigerant will not have any harmful effects on the ozone layer of
                        the atmosphere. Because there is not enough evidence to determine the "greenhouse" effect of
                        R-134a, recycling of R-134a is recommended.
