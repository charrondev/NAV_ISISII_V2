            <para>A malfunctioning HVAC system is received because the operator feels that the system is not operating
                correctly. Usually, the operator will provide a symptom describing the operation of the system.
                Effective diagnosis begins with observing any Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTC) logged by the Electronic
                Gauge Cluster (EGC). If no diagnostic trouble codes are displayed, verify the reported fault by
                operating the system and observing the symptoms.

            <title>Refrigerant Control and Diagnostic (RCD) System</title>
            <para>The Refrigerant Control and Diagnostic (RCD) System is the software used by the Electrical System
                Controller (ESC) to monitor and control A/C system operation. The RCD system monitors the refrigerant
                sensors (transducer and thermistors) and other system parameters to determine if all parameters are
                within acceptable limits. This information allows the RCD system to keep the A/C system operating within
                its optimum range by controlling the cycling of the refrigerant compressor. When certain nondestructive
                conditions are detected, the RCD system will allow the A/C system to continue operating while it
                generates diagnostic trouble codes that may be used to diagnose and isolate the source of the problem.
                If destructive conditions are detected, the RCD system will protect the compressor by commanding the ESC
                to turn the compressor off, shutting down the A/C system. In addition, the RCD system will also generate
                diagnostic trouble codes that may be used to diagnose and isolate problems in the system. For a more
                complete description of the RCD system, refer to

                    <para>The RCD system is continually being improved and revised. If an invalid DTC has been set (see

                        is suspected of being out of date, contact Technical Services at 1-800-336-4500 to determine if
                        reflashing the ESC is necessary.

            <title>Diagnostic Trouble Codes</title>
            <para>The RCD system within the ESC monitors parameters throughout the A/C system and generates diagnostic
                trouble codes whenever a measured parameter falls outside of its specified range. Also within the HVAC
                system, the HVAC control head monitors some conditions and notifies the ESC when it detects a fault. The
                ESC assigns a Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) to each of these faults. When any DTC is generated it is
                stored in memory even if the fault condition is only temporary. If a fault is detected once, and then
                not detected at a later time, the DTC for that fault is stored as an inactive
                <emph type="bold">(Previously active)</emph>
                fault in a memory circuit located in the Electronic Gauge Cluster (EGC). If the detected fault is still
                present it is considered an
                <emph type="bold">Active</emph>
                fault. Faults that are severe enough to inhibit HVAC compressor operation are displayed as Active
                faults.
            </para>
            <para>The DTC's are viewed by placing the system into the diagnostic mode. The following figure (
