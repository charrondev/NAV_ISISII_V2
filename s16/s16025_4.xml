            <para>The following figure (
                <hotlnk xrefid="f1602504">Figure 4</hotlnk>) is a cross-sectional view of the air-handling components of
                the HVAC system, as they are mounted in the vehicle. The figure shows the system's four air doors and
                indicates their range of travel.
            </para>
            <para>The electrically actuated fresh/recirculate air door (13) is located in the evaporator housing (11),
                and is controlled by the mode control (right knob) on the HVAC control panel. When the door is in the
                recirculate position, outside air is blocked by the door. Recirculation air, from the cab, enters the
                upper rear of the evaporator housing through the upper portion of the dash panel cutout (12). With the
                fresh/recirculate air door in the fresh air position, fresh outside air enters the top of the evaporator
                housing via an air duct which is part of the cowl drain tray (14). (The recirculate air is blocked by
                the fresh/recirculate air door.) In both cases the air is pulled by the blower assembly (8) through the
                near-vertically mounted plate/fin evaporator core (10) to exit the evaporator housing through the lower
                portion of the dash panel cutout. An air filter (optional on some models) can be mounted vertically in
                front of the evaporator core. The air entering the heater housing from the evaporator housing enters the
                dual inlet, single scroll blower assembly and is pushed through the heater housing.

            <para>The temperature blend door (7) is controlled by the temperature control (center knob) on the HVAC
                control panel. The electrically actuated temperature blend door diverts air from the blower assembly
                (8), either through the heater core (6), or around it depending on the temperature selected for the
                outlet air.&#160; Engine coolant flows through the heater core at all times. The air proceeds to the
                mode doors.

            <para>The two mode doors, defrost/floor (4) and IP vent/floor (5), are controlled by the mode control (right
                knob) on the HVAC control panel. The doors are located at the top of the heater housing and are
                controlled together via kinematics and another electrical actuator. These mode doors direct air to the
                air outlets (floor ducts, instrument panel vents, and/or defrost vents) based on the mode selected by
                the operator. The ductwork for the instrument panel vents (3) and the defrost vents (1) is integrated
                into the instrument panel structure. The upper surfaces of the heater housing interface with ductwork
                through two large openings in the bottom of the Instrument Panel (I/P). Left-hand drive (LHD) vehicles
                have a passenger floor duct attached to the right side of the heater housing and a driver side floor
                duct (2) attached to the left side of the housing.

                is blocked by the door. Recirculation air (REC), from the cab, enters the upper rear of the evaporator
                housing through the upper portion of the dash panel cutout. (This air inlet is located behind the heater
                housing.) The air is pulled by the blower assembly, through the evaporator core. The air entering the
                heater housing from the evaporator housing enters the dual inlet, single scroll blower assembly and is

                core or past it depending on the temperature selected for the outlet air. Although the temperature
                control is operational while in the A/C modes, the temperature control is generally set to divert all

            <para>The suction side of the compressor draws low pressure refrigerant vapor (5 to 50 psi) from the low
                side of the system, coming from the accumulator. The compressor then compresses the refrigerant vapor
                and discharges it at increased temperature and pressure (120 to 300 psi) through the high side line
                which connects the compressor to the condenser.
            </para>
            <para>An internal lubricating system uses the suction side intake crankcase pressure differential to coat
                internal parts with a thin film of oil. This lubrication also travels along with the refrigerant
                throughout the air conditioning system to lubricate various system components.
            </para>
            <para>High pressure/high temperature refrigerant vapor from the compressor enters at the top of the
                condenser, circulates down through the coils and exits at the bottom of the condenser as high
                pressure/high temperature refrigerant liquid. As the vapor condenses (changes state), some of its heat
                is released to the coils and fins of the condenser. This heat is continually carried away by the outside
                air which passes over the external fin surfaces as it flows through the condenser.
            </para>
            <para>The efficiency of the condenser operation is affected by ram air flowing through the condenser. For
                this reason, it is important that the engine cooling fan be operating properly, and that the condenser
                cooling fins remain free of airborne contamination (leaves, insects, dirt, etc.) which can block the
                fins and cause system temperatures to run higher than normal.
            </para>
            <para>When operating properly, the condenser acts as an efficient heat exchanger, containing refrigerant
                vapor in approximately two-thirds of the upper portion of its coils and condensed refrigerant liquid in
                the lower one-third portion. A pressure transducer located in the output line of the condenser is used
                to control system operation by providing inputs to the Refrigerant Control and Diagnostic (RCD) System.
                The condenser passes high temperature/high pressure liquid refrigerant to the evaporator input orifice
                tube.
            </para>
            <para>While the high pressure/high temperature liquid refrigerant is present on the condenser side of the
                evaporator orifice, the suction side of the compressor is reducing the pressure in the evaporator and at
                the output side of the orifice. The pressure differential causes a measured amount of the high pressure
                liquid refrigerant to flow through the calibrated orifice and enter the low pressure evaporator as a low
                temperature liquid. The orifice is the dividing line between the high pressure side of the system and
                the low pressure side of the system.
            </para>
            <para>Within the evaporator core, the lower pressure permits the liquid refrigerant to boil or evaporate,
                changing its state from a liquid to a low pressure/low temperature vapor; and absorbing heat from the
                evaporator core and the air surrounding it. Cooling and dehumidifying of the cab's interior takes place
                as the refrigerant vapor passes through the evaporator's finned tubes and absorbs heat from the cab air
                pulled through the evaporator core by the system blower. Humidity condenses on the external surfaces of
                the cooled evaporator fins and is channeled (drained) out of the evaporator housing through drain
                valves. The refrigerant exits the evaporator outlet as a low pressure/low temperature vapor and is drawn
                into the accumulator by the suction created by the compressor.
            </para>
            <para>Thermistors are located at the input and output of the evaporator to monitor the temperature or the
                refrigerant at these points. The inputs from these sensors are used to control system operation by
                providing inputs to the Refrigerant Control and Diagnostic (RCD) System.
