                controls the two mode doors located at the top of the heater housing via a kinematics (gear drive)
                system. The two doors direct air flow to the air outlets (floor ducts, instrument panel vents, and/or
                defrost vents) based on the mode selected by the operator.
            </para>
            <para>The position of the actuator motor (and mode doors) is controlled by the setting of the mode control
                (right knob) on the HVAC control head. When a mode is selected that requires a change in position of the
                mode doors, the control head will apply a drive voltage to the motor causing it to turn the doors to the
                desired position. Circuitry within the control head senses when the mode doors reach the desired
                position, and stops outputting the drive voltage.
            </para>
            <para>Because the actuator motor can be driven in either direction the drive voltage can be of either
                polarity. In order to position the doors correctly, circuitry within the control head keeps track of the
                actuator position at all times based on a known starting position. It can then drive the actuator to any
                position by applying a drive voltage of the correct polarity, and sensing (counting) the number of
                actuator motor revolutions through the actuator circuits. To establish a known starting position, the
                control head runs the actuator and doors through a calibration procedure when battery voltage is first
                applied to the HVAC control head, and then at regular intervals during normal operation.
