        <para>The use of a refrigerant (recovery/recycling/recharging) station is recommended for servicing this A/C
            system. If a refrigerant station is not available, refrigerant system recovery, evacuation and charging may
            be accomplished using a separate recovery station, vacuum pump, charging meter and manifold gauge set. If
            separate equipment is used, refer to the manufacturer's instructions supplied with that equipment.
