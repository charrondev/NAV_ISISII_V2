            and moisture before being recharged. After evacuation the system vacuum should read at least 99.4 kPa (29.5
            in-Hg) and as close to 101.1 kPa (30 in-Hg) as possible, when using analog gauges. If the electronic vacuum
            gauge is used the vacuum in the evacuated system should measure between 750 and 1000 microns.
