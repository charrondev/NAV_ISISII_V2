                        the function of the equipment used to perform each service procedure is basically the same. If
                        you are performing these service procedures using service equipment different from that shown,
                        refer to the manufacturer's instructions supplied with that equipment.

            <para>A flush gun, along with compressed dry nitrogen, is required to inject the flushing agent into the
                component being flushed. All items can be obtained locally.
            </para>
            <para>Systems that have had an internal compressor failure, that have been overcharged with refrigeration
                oil, or that have been left open for an extended period of time, will need to be flushed, purged or
                both. Flushing is generally necessary only after an internal compressor failure has contaminated the
                refrigerant system. Flushing and purging are performed on a system after the refrigerant has been
                recovered and before the system is reassembled and evacuated.
            </para>
            <para>Flushing removes heavy contamination, such as gritty oil and large dirt buildup, which occur after an
                internal compressor failure. When a part is flushed, a flushing solvent is forced through it; the liquid
                solvent cleans the part, picks up contaminants and flushes them out.
            </para>
            <para>Purging must always be performed: after flushing the system; any time there is excessive refrigerant
                oil found in the system; or, when the system has been left open for an extended period of time. Purging
                removes flushing solvent, excessive refrigerant oil, damp air, and loose particles from A/C system
                components by passing a stream of inert, dry nitrogen gas through parts of the system or individual
                components. This assures that A/C system components are dry and free of any contaminants. If left in the
                system, these contaminants would have a negative effect on the life and operation of the air
                conditioning system.
