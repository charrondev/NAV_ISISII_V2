            <para>The Blend-Air air conditioning and heating system is a system of components designed to provide
                conditioned air to the occupants of the vehicle. The term "Blend-Air" refers to the mixing or blending
                together of air from the cooling and heating systems to produce a desired air temperature for the
                vehicle occupants. The two main modules (the heater module and evaporator module) are mounted on
                opposite sides of the dash panel on the passenger side of the vehicle (

            <para>The evaporator core, expansion valve, filter drier, thermistors, fresh/recirculate air door, air door
                actuator, and air filter(s) are located on, or near, the dash mounted evaporator housing on the engine
                side of the dash panel, under the hood (

                <note>
                    <para>A heater-only version of the system is also available. The heater components and operation are
                        identical to those described for the air conditioning and heating system. The heater-only
                        version also uses the evaporator housing, without the refrigerant circuit components, as a means
                        of directing air to the heater module.

                The heater core, blower motor, blower motor speed control module, blower air scroll housing, passenger
                floor duct, and air door actuators are located in (or on) the in-cab heater module and may be serviced
                without removing the heater module housing. The heater module (2, Figure 1) is located behind the heater
                trim cover (4, Figure 3).
