            <title>Compressor and Clutch</title>
            <para>The system uses a Sanden Model SD7 compressor configured with a proprietary International head to
                accommodate the "C-plate" block-style fittings. It is mounted on the engine and is belt-driven through
                an electromagnetic clutch which acts to engage (turn ON) or disengage (turn OFF) the compressor in
                response to the air conditioning system controls (HVAC control panel and Body Controller). When engaged,
                the clutch armature assembly is magnetically drawn to the pulley assembly on the compressor shaft,
                thereby engaging the clutch and allowing the drive belt to drive the compressor. A pressure relief valve
                on the compressor offers protection to the compressor in extreme high pressure conditions.

            <title>Condenser</title>
            <para>The air conditioning condenser is located at the front of the vehicle between the engine radiator and
                the grille. The condenser is a heat exchanger made of fin and tube construction, with "C-plate"
                block-style inlet and outlet fittings.

            <title>Pressure Transducer</title>
            <para>The pressure transducer (
                <hotlnk xrefid="f1603407">Figure 7</hotlnk>) is a pressure-sensing device threaded into the condenser
                refrigerant output line. The transducer provides an electrical signal to the Body Controller which
                monitors and controls the operation of the A/C system. The refrigerant system does not have to be
                discharged to replace the pressure transducer.

            <title>Filter-Drier</title>
            <para>The primary function of the filter-drier (
                <hotlnk xrefid="f1603408">Figure 8</hotlnk>) is to remove any moisture or solid contamination from the
                refrigerant before it can cycle through the system and cause internal damage. A drying agent (desiccant)
                separates and absorbs any moisture contained in the liquid refrigerant. The desiccant also contains a
                dye to allow easier detection of refrigerant leaks.
            </para>
            <para>The filter-drier itself is not repairable, and must be replaced if found to be defective. The
                filter-drier must also be replaced whenever the system becomes contaminated due to a internal compressor
                failure or any extended exposure to the atmosphere (30 minutes or longer). This action will help prevent
                subsequent corrosion and damage to the system.

            <title>Thermostatic Expansion Valve (TXV)</title>
            <para>The expansion valve (
                <hotlnk xrefid="f1603409">Figure 9</hotlnk>) controls the amount of liquid refrigerant that enters the
                evaporator core. The valve is connected to both the input and output lines of the evaporator core. By
                sensing the temperature of the refrigerant at the output of the evaporator, the valve determines what
                amount of refrigerant is needed at the evaporator input to keep the evaporator operating within
                operational parameters.

            <title>Evaporator</title>
            <para>The evaporator core (10,
                <hotlnk document="s16034_4.xml" xrefid="f1603404">Figure 4</hotlnk>) is located in the evaporator
                housing mounted on the engine side of the dash panel. The core is a cooling assembly made of tube and
                fin construction, with "C-plate" block-style inlet and outlet fittings. Drain valves for both condensate
                and rain water are incorporated into the bottom of the evaporator housing. Service access for the air
                filter is through the large fresh air inlet in the cowl tray and the top surface of the evaporator
                housing.

        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Thermistors (Evaporator Inlet and Outlet)</title>
            <para>The inlet thermistor (
                <hotlnk xrefid="f1603410">Figure 10</hotlnk>) is mounted in the evaporator inlet line. This thermistor
                senses the temperature of the refrigerant entering the evaporator. Another thermistor is mounted to the
                evaporator outlet line immediately after the TXV to sense the refrigerant temperature at the evaporator
                outlet. The resistance value of each thermistor is determined by the temperature of the refrigerant at
                its location. The resistance values of these thermistors are monitored by the software in the Body
                Controller which is used to control A/C system operation and detect system faults. The refrigerant
                system must be discharged before removing and replacing either thermistor.

            <title>A/C Plumbing</title>
            <para>International "C-plate" style block fittings are utilized on all refrigerant line connections except
                the TXV. This block fitting incorporates a secondary moisture and dirt seal within a unique plate
                inserted into the block fitting. The primary O-ring seal has a large cross section for improved sealing
                as well. Refrigerant hose assemblies are constructed from steel tubing coupled to Goodyear Galaxy hose.
                This nylon barrier type of hose prevents the refrigerant from escaping through the walls of the hose
                into the atmosphere. When servicing air conditioning systems, use only replacement hoses approved for
                air conditioning systems.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Heater Core</title>
            <para>The heater core is located in the heater housing mounted in the cab under the right side of the
                instrument panel. The heater core is a heating assembly made of fin and tube construction, with inlet
                and outlet fittings for connecting the heater hoses from the engine cooling system. The inlet and outlet
                fittings protrude through the cowl directly above the evaporator housing. Engine coolant flows through
                the heater core at all times. The temperature of the air output by the heating/air conditioning system
                is determined by diverting more or less of the input air through the heater core. The heater core is
                serviced from inside the cab.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Blower Assembly</title>
            <para>The blower assembly is located in the blower scroll housing (part of the heater unit), mounted in the
                cab under the right side of the instrument panel. The blower assembly used in the heater or heater-air
                conditioning system consists of a permanent magnet motor attached to a balanced 'squirrel-cage' fan
                unit. The motor speed is controlled by the left knob on the HVAC control panel on the instrument panel.
                The blower provides air circulation through the heater core and evaporator, and delivery of the treated
                air throughout the cab interior.
            </para>
        </svcsubproc>
        <svcsubproc>
            <title>Linear Power Module</title>
            <para>The Linear Power Module (LPM) (
                <hotlnk xrefid="f1603411">Figure 11</hotlnk>) is mounted to the blower scroll housing (part of the
                heater unit), located in the cab under the right side of the instrument panel. The LPM establishes the
                blower speed by reading the HVAC control panel output signal whose value is based on the setting of the
                blower speed control knob. As the blower speed control is turned cw the LPM increases the voltage across
                the blower motor, and the blower speed increases.

            <title>HVAC Control Panel</title>
            <para>The HVAC control panel is located in the center console of the instrument panel. The control panel
                consists of three knobs actuating three long life potentiometers. Internally, the control panel contains
                circuitry that electronically controls the blower motor speed and the three air door actuator motors.
                The blower speed control is detented to provide seven distinct blower speeds, in addition to the OFF
                position. The temperature control has fifteen detents. The mode control is used to select the HVAC
                operating mode, indicated by seven mode icons and five dots (for 'in-between' modes). The 'heat only'
                system has five mode icons, and four dots for 'in-between' modes.
