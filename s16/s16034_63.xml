        <para>The Recovery/Recycling/Recharging Station (ZTSE4615) for R-134a is a totally integrated A/C service
            system, which recovers, recycles, evacuates, and recharges R-134a quickly and accurately (refer to
            <hotlnk xrefid="f1603453">Figure 53</hotlnk>).

        <para>With its built-in manifold, all A/C service work is done with one hookup. The unit is programmed at its
            panel-mounted keypad. Computerized controls and solenoids precisely monitor evacuation and charging time. It
            is designed to automatically shut off after the recovery cycle. A moisture indicator will change from yellow
            to green when recycling is complete.
