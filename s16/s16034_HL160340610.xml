                    <para>If you were referenced to this procedure from the heater housing removal procedure; note that
                        on some vehicles it may be possible to unmount the evaporator housing and move it away from the
                        cowl enough to remove the heater housing mounting nuts (located behind the evaporator housing),
                        WITHOUT disconnecting the A/C lines. Inspect the vehicle being serviced and review the following
                        procedure to determine if complete removal of the evaporator housing is necessary. If it is
                        determined that disconnection of the A/C lines is unnecessary, review the following procedures
                        and perform only the steps required to remove the evaporator housing from the cowl. If this
                        method is followed, it will still be necessary to unclamp A/C lines to allow movement. When
                        positioning the evaporator housing out of the way DO NOT kink the A/C lines.
