            <para>The heater trim cover must be removed prior to removing any of the HVAC components located under the
                right side of the instrument panel (IP). Removal and installation of the heater trim cover may require
                the removal of other trim panels. The panels that must be removed vary by vehicle model and trim level.
                Refer to the appropriate CAB section(s) in GROUP 16 of the Master Service Manual for additional
                procedures.
