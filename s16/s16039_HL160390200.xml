        <svcsubsecinfo>
            <para>The Blend-Air air conditioning and heating system is a system of components designed to provide
                conditioned air to the occupants of the vehicle. The term "Blend-Air" refers to the mixing or blending
                together of air from the cooling and heating systems to produce a desired air temperature for the
                vehicle occupants. The front HVAC system is used in both day cab and sleeper cab vehicles. The rear
                (sleeper) HVAC system is used only in sleeper vehicles, and is described in separate sections of this
                manual.
            </para>
            <para>The front HVAC system is comprised of two main modules, the heater module and evaporator module. These
                modules are mounted on opposite sides of the dash panel on the passenger side of the vehicle (

                floor duct, and air door actuators are located in (or on) the in-cab heater module and may be serviced
                without removing the heater module housing. The heater module (2, Figure 1) is located behind the heater
                trim cover (4, Figure 3).
