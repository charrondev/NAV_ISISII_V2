                    <para>Removing and installing the heater housing requires detaching and raising the Instrument Panel
                        (IP), and removing the evaporator housing from the cowl. Replacement of the heater housing is
                        necessary only if either the mode door mechanism or the housing itself is damaged. In either
                        case the entire heater housing is replaced as an assembly.
