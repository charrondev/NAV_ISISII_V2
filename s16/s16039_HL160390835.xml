            <para>In order to repair internal components, the rear HVAC unit may be disassembled in the cab or removed
                as a unit and disassembled on the bench. The method used depends on the repair being performed.

            <para>Removing and installing the rear HVAC unit as an assembly requires discharging the A/C system and
                disconnecting the rear heater core lines. All internal components of the rear HVAC unit can be replaced
                by removing the top of the housing while the unit is mounted in the vehicle. Removal of the entire rear
                HVAC unit is necessary only if the lower housing itself is damaged. In this situation, it may be
                beneficial to remove the entire rear HVAC unit from the vehicle so the repairs can be performed on the
                bench, before re-installing the unit into the vehicle. Whenever the rear HVAC unit is removed or
                installed, the heater core inlet/outlet tubes should be removed to prevent damage to the tubes.
