                It is recommended that the vehicle being serviced is moved more than 100 feet from other TPMS equipped
                vehicles and/or wheels. If it is not feasible to move the vehicle away from other TPMS equipped vehicles
                and/or wheels, remove 2-3 PSI air pressure from the tire within one second. This will place the tire
                sensor in fast transmit mode for approximately 2 minutes. That sensor will then appear 1st in the list
                of detected sensors on the Tire Transmitter ID screen (and with an asterisk), which helps to identify
                the particular wheel.

            <para>The VID will display all detected sensors. In the example above, there are 4 Tire Transmitter IDs
                detected. The first ID in the list (0300060115) is the sensor which was removed. This allows the user a
                chance to add the sensor back if it was mistakenly removed (this is also useful when rotating wheels,
                since the other wheel will be displayed 1st). The other 3 IDs are sensors which the TPMS antenna
                detects, but are not associated with that particular wheel location.
