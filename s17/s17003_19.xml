            <caution>
                <para>If you notice either a label located in the wheel hand hole area or what appears to be a stud
                    mounted 180 degrees from the valve stem, you must follow the instructions on the attached bulletin
                    from the manufacturer when removing and installing the tire. Failure to follow these instructions
                    when removing or mounting a tire could cause the tire pressure monitor to break off inside the wheel
                    resulting in a loose sensor inside of the tire and wheel assembly. This can eventually lead to tire
                    damage or failure of the tire pressure sensor.

            <emph type="bold">Mounting Locations</emph>: On Super Singles, the wheel sensor is mounted to a stud and nut
            (Figure 39 and 40). On regular tires, the sensor is mounted inside the rim on a special valve stem (Figures
            41 and 42). Follow the procedures below.
