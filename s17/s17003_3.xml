            <para>The TPMS controller receives battery voltage from the interior power distribution center (PDC). The
                accessory relay provides voltage to the TPMS controller when the key switch is placed in the ACCESSORY
                or ON position. This 'wakes up' the TPMS controller. The TPMS controller is permanently grounded at the
                ground stud.
            </para>
            <para>Each tire is monitored by a tire pressure sensor. These sensors are not hardwired. Instead, the tire
                pressure sensor transmits a radio frequency (RF) signal which is received by the tire pressure antenna.
                The tire pressure antennas have been located to optimize system performance. Reception of the front
                wheels is performed primarily by the front tire pressure antenna. Reception of the rear wheels is
                performed primarily by the left rear and right rear tire pressure antennas.
            </para>
            <para>The antenna units are connected to the TPMS controller by LIN bus, which consists of three circuits
                per antenna. The TPMS controller provides a zero volt reference (ZVR) and 12V signal to each antenna.
                The antenna communicates information to the TPMS controller on the signal circuit. The TPMS controller
                processes the data received from the antennas and sends the information to the vehicle information
                display (VID) via the SAE J1939 data link.

            <title>SAE J1939 Communication</title>
            <para>The tire pressure monitoring controller communicates with the vehicle information display (VID) by
                means of the SAE J1939 data link for various functions such as:

            <para>Communication is considered 'lost' if the VID has not received a 'heartbeat' from the TPMS controller
                for 30 seconds.

                seconds on the LIN bus.
