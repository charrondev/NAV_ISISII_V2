            <title>Driver Side Sliding Storm Window (Optional)</title>
            <para>The driver side sliding window is also supplied with a sliding storm window option. The window is
                designed for use in colder climates and eliminates frost build up on the window in adverse weather. The
                window glass is a heavier and thicker design. This sliding window assembly utilizes a thicker thermal
                type glass mounted in an aluminum extrusion. The window is mounted in the window frame area but has an
                offset extruded framework to compensate for the glass thickness.

            <title>Body Tie Down Bolts And Assemblies</title>
            <para>The body tie down bolts are mechanical fasteners that secure the body floor panels to the chassis
                frame rail. This application consists of a combination of body tie down clips and 1/2 inch - 13 x 11 1/2
                inch bolts and nuts equipped with j-bars that fit around the chassis frame rail. A high durometer
                anti-squeak rubber is located between the bus body floor and the chassis frame rail. The anti-squeak
                function is to absorb and dampen sound and vibration. Anti-squeak should be in place before the tie down
                bolts are torqued.
            </para>
            <para>The body tie down bolts should be tightened within 30 days or 1,000- 2,000 miles and quarterly
                thereafter. The tie down bolts should be torqued 35 to 40 Lbf-ft. (47.5-54 Nm). The body tie down bolts,
                front outrigger mounting bolts, shear bolts and standard tie downs should be part of a normal
                preventative maintenance check.
