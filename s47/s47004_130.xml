        <title>Fuel Sender Access Hatch</title>
        <para>The fuel sender access hatch may be located in different positions depending on the location of the fuel
            tank. With rear mounted fuel tanks (between the frame rails) the fuel sender access hatch is located in the
            center isle toward the rear of the bus. With side mounted fuel tanks, the fuel sender access hatch or
            opening is located above the tank generally on the right (curb) side of the bus body. Check the floor under
            the forward passenger seats for the access location.
