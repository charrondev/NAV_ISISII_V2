            <para>All heating systems used in the vehicles are hot water type. This type system depends on the vehicle's
                engine to generate heat from the engine coolant or antifreeze. The engine coolant is pumped through the
                heater hoses, then to the heaters. The primary heating system is plumbed in a "series water flow"
                system. In this type of system, the heater coolant supply hose is routed to each heater and returns to
                the engine after exiting the last heater in the system.
            </para>
            <para>Heaters are made up of tube and fin type coils. When the coolant flows through the coils, the blowers
                move air across the fins of the coil and pick up the heat from the coolant.
            </para>
            <para>This section is for the repair and maintenance of the bus interior heaters. It is advised that caution
                be taken during any repairs or maintenance to the heater system and that the recommended procedures as
                defined in the manufacturer's instruction manual be followed.
