        <title>Fuel Fill</title>
        <para>The CE series bus fuel fill assembly is located on the passenger side of the bus body. The fuel fill may
            be located at the forward section passenger side of the bus (
            <hotlnk xrefid="f4700417">Fig. 17 Item 3</hotlnk>), aft of the side entry door on buses equipped with side
            frame rail mounted fuel tanks. The fuel tank and fuel fill may be located on the driver side of the bus.
            Access to the fuel filler assembly may require a key if fuel fill door is of the locking type. Buses with
            fuel tanks located aft the rear axle and between the frame rails have the fuel fill located on the passenger
            side of the body behind the rear wheel well openings. A spring hinged fuel fill door with or without lock or
            latching mechanisms are utilized on the fuel fill access doors.
