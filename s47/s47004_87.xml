        <title>Under Body Compartments</title>
        <para>The luggage boxes or underbody compartments are located along the lower line of the body and attached to
            the floor structure flange sections. The front face of the compartment door frame is on the side sheet and
            attached with mounting screws (
            <hotlnk document="s47004_22.xml" xrefid="f4700427">Fig. 27, Item 2</hotlnk>). The luggage compartment has
            luggage box hanger brackets attached to the rear of the compartment upper surface with a "J" clip assembly
            clipped to the frame rail upper flange. The luggage box mounting brackets are welded to the rear wall of the
            luggage compartment. The upper flanges of the luggage compartment are spot welded to the floor structure
            lower flange. The number of luggage box mounting brackets may vary depending on the overall length of the
            compartment.
