            <para>The RE 200 and RE 300 bus bodies are designed as a unit, which means that every structural part is
                tied to other structural parts to form a whole. This concept is known as unit body construction. The
                strength and durability of the bus body depends on the structural integrity of the unit. If any
                structural part is damaged or removed, the entire bus body integrity is weakened. Therefore, a damaged
                structural part must be carefully repaired or replaced exactly as it was originally so body strength can
                be restored. All units are to meet all applicable F.M.V.S.S. requirements as of the date of manufacture.
                The
                <emph type="bold">floor</emph>
                of the bus is designed as the foundation upon which the rest of the body is constructed. If the floor is
                ever twisted or damaged (other than superficial or cosmetic damage), it cannot be repaired, and the bus
                must be removed from service.
