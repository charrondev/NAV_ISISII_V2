        <title>Instrument Cluster</title>
        <para>The cluster is a reliable, quick-disconnect package for the most commonly used instruments. Should the
            need arise, the cluster body can be quickly detached from the instrument panel for quick access to any of
            its components. Either the complete cluster assembly or any of its components can be replaced.
        </para>
        <specpara>
            <note>
                <para>It is recommended that the entire cluster be removed from the instrument panel to perform gauge
                    removal and/or installation. This provides more work room and minimizes the risk of damaging the
                    cluster or instruments.
