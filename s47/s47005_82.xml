        <title>Driver Seat Belts</title>
        <para>The standard driver seat belt assembly is a three point lap and shoulder harness assembly, with retractor.
            The shoulder harness and the shoulder harness mounting assembly are attached to the structural pillar at the
            rear of the driver side sliding side window. The lap connection is mounted to the driver floor riser
            assembly. The lap connector assembly is bolted through the floor utilizing grade eight structural bolts and
            lock nuts and washers.

                <para>The seat belt should be considered to have a limited life and must be replaced as needed
                    throughout the life of the vehicle. The belts must be inspected for needed care and maintenance
                    every 20,000 miles or more often if exposed to severe environmental or vocational conditions. All
                    belts should be replaced at least every 5 years. Failure to maintain the seat belts could weaken the
                    system, resulting in personal injury or death.
