        <para>The driver seat bulkhead or passenger crash barriers are located each side, forward of the first row of
            passenger seats. Additional barriers may be specified at the emergency exit doors or wheelchair access door
            (if specified). The barrier at the front curb side passenger seat may equipped with an assist rail. To
