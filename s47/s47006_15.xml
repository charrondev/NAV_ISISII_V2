        <title>Fuel Fill</title>
        <para>The BE series bus fuel fill assembly is located on the passenger side of the bus body. The fuel fill may
            be located at the forward section passenger side of the bus (
            <hotlnk xrefid="f4700635">Fig. 35 Item 3</hotlnk>), aft of the side entry door on buses equipped with side
            frame rail mounted fuel tanks. The fuel tank and fuel fill may be located on the driver side of the bus.
            Access to the fuel filler assembly may require a key if fuel fill door is of the locking type. Buses with
            fuel tanks located aft of the rear axle and between the frame rails have the fuel fill located on the
            passenger side of the body behind the rear wheel well openings. A spring hinged fuel fill door with or
            without lock or latching mechanisms are utilized on the fuel fill access doors.
