        <title>Emergency Exit Doors, Buzzers and Latches</title>
        <para>The side and or rear emergency exit door should be inspected daily for proper operation, as stated by the
            instruction decal. The door buzzer / alarm should be checked with the ignition switch in the "ON" position.
            If the door buzzer sounds after the door has been closed, check the door switch adjustment and electrical
            installation to determine the cause of the problem. The door switch will require an adjustment in or out to
            eliminate the problem.
