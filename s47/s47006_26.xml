        <title>Chair Lift Door and Chair Lift</title>
        <para>Optional handicapped access requirements are an available option. The wheelchair lift is available in
            different configurations. Depending on the district requirement the chair lift may be located at the rear
            side bus, at mid point, or directly behind the passenger entry door (
            <hotlnk xrefid="f4700649">Fig. 49, Item 1</hotlnk>). Depending on the location, the door may swing left or
            right.

        <para>The chair lift option is available from different manufacturers as may be requested by the customer. The
            chair lift assembly is mounted directly inside the body by the chair lift door. The entire mechanism,
            depending on manufacturer, is either all electric control or hydraulically controlled. The chair lift door
            latching mechanism is equipped with a door open sensor which activates when the handle is opened, and alerts
            the driver the door is ajar. The chair lift operating functions are detailed in the chair lift operators
            manual if the bus is so equipped.
