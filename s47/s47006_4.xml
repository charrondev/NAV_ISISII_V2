            <para>The BE 200 bus bodies are designed as a unit, which means that every structural part is tied to other
                structural parts to form a whole. This concept is known as unit body construction. The strength and
                durability of the bus body depends on the structural integrity of the unit. If any structural part is
                damaged or removed, the entire bus body integrity is weakened. Therefore, a damaged structural part must
                be carefully repaired or replaced exactly as it was originally so body strength can be restored. All
                units are to meet all applicable F.M.V.S.S. requirements as of the date of manufacture. The
                <emph type="bold">floor</emph>
                of the bus is designed as the foundation upon which the rest of the body is constructed. If the floor is
                ever twisted or damaged (other than superficial or cosmetic damage) it cannot be repaired, and the bus
                must be removed from service.
