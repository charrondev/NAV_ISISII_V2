            pendant consists of the pendant controller (Item 1), the mounting clip (Item 2), and the power cable
            connector (Item 3). The pendant assembly connector plugs into the base section of the hydraulic pump
            assembly (

        <para>The wheelchair lift contains a powerful electro-hydraulic pump that includes a built-in manual back up
            pump. If the unit loses electrical power, it can be raised or lowered manually. By using the control switch,
            the lift is unfolded out from the vehicle. The user boards the large non-skid platform and the operator uses
            the control switch to gently lower the platform to the ground. After the user departs, the platform is
            raised and folded into the vehicle (stowed). It is important to user safety that the lift operator be
            completely familiar with the operating instructions. Once the lift is installed, it is also important that
            the lift be properly maintained by following the manufacturer recommended cleaning, lubrication, and
            inspection instructions. If the bus is equipped with a wheelchair lift, check the lift instruction, and
            maintenance manual for the proper procedures to maintain the lift.

        </para>
        <para>The wheelchair lift door assembly is similar in operation to the Emergency Exit Door. The door is equipped
            with an open door activation relay that notifies the driver in the event the door latch has been opened. The
            chair lift door is a full 180 degree swing open door with a door restraint cable and clip located on the
            outside bus body (
            <hotlnk xrefid="f4700699">Fig. 99, Item 3</hotlnk>).
        </para>
        <para>The door latch mechanism is opened from the outside of the vehicle by lifting the handle (
            <hotlnk document="s47006_26.xml" xrefid="f4700649">Fig. 49, Item 4</hotlnk>) upward and pulling the door
            open.

            <title>Chair Lift Door Secure Cable</title>
        </para>
        <para>When the wheelchair access door is opened and the lift to be put in operation, the access door must be
            secured in the open position. The door is hinged to swing a full 180 degrees to the full open position. A
            cable stop is located on the interior door assembly and clipped in place on the exterior body latch ring.
            This cable allows the operator to ensure the door is secure during operation of the chair lift.
