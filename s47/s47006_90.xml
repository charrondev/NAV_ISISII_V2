                <para>There are many variations of window and glass arrangements installed in school bus applications.
                    However, the installation and maintenance procedures given in this section can be used as a general
                    information that is contingent on state specifications (optional equipment).
                </para>

        <para>All glass in this vehicle meets F.M.V.S.S. requirements. Should the glass require replacing, replace with
            the same type of glass and glass mounting seal. The windshield is a flat three piece assembly. Replacing the
            windshield assembly requires a qualified glass technician and helper. The windshield is an AS-1 laminated
            safety glass, tinted 73% light transmission and sealed with a rubber "S" style gasket and lace. Installation
            of the windshield lace requires a special tool to properly insert and seal the windshield assembly.

                <para>Always wear eye protection and other safety equipment when handling glass to minimize the risk of
                    injury.

        <para>If the glass is broken, it may already have fallen or been removed from the rubber seal. It is often
            necessary to remove cracked or otherwise imperfect glass that is still intact. In this case, it is a good
            practice to criss-cross the glass with strips of masking tape before removal. This will help hold the glass
            together and minimize the risk of injury.
