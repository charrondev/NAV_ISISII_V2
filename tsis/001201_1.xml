                <para>Starting November 6, 2000, (serial number 1277933) International is releasing a four-post
                    compressor housing to replace the three-post housings on all current and new I6 turbochargers.
                    Current turbochargers will be serviced with the new

                    </hotlnk>
                    which will extend the fatigue life of ported shroud turbochargers by eliminating the possibility of
                    compressor blade resonance. This change has no effect on engine performance or emissions, and does
                    not effect regularly scheduled service intervals. International continues to use ported shroud
                    turbochargers on engine application 230BHP and higher.
