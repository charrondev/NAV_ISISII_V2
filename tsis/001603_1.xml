                <para>5000i and 9000i Models have a view window located in the bottom front corner of the passenger door
                    (
                    <hotlnk xrefid="f0016031">Figure 1</hotlnk>). This view window is comprised of an outer glass panel
                    located on the door outer skin and an inner, vented, glass panel located on the door trim panel (
                    <hotlnk xrefid="f0016032">Figure 2</hotlnk>).
                </para>
                <para>Water droplets from rain or condensation may collect on the surfaces of the view window glass
                    inside the door (
                    <hotlnk xrefid="f0016032">Figure 2</hotlnk>). THIS OCCURRENCE IS CONSIDERED NORMAL. Water will drain
                    out through two holes located in the bottom of the door. In addition, the inside view window glass
                    panel has two vent openings to allow cab air to circulate between the inner and outer glass panels
                    to clear condensation from these surfaces.
