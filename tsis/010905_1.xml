                <para>Fender extension material on 4300, 4400 models changed from Xenoy to GTX in production on October
                    17, 2001. In addition, design changes were made to increase tire clearance with large tires. The new
                    GTX material has a specific paint requirement.

                        the fender extension to crack in very cold weather. Mask these areas as shown in Figures 1 and 2
                        with a minimum 1" wide masking tape prior to painting. Production and service parts fender
                        extensions will already have the tape applied.
