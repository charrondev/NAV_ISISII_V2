                    clockspring cancels, or turns off, the turn signal when the steering wheel is turned, whereas a
                    "non-canceling" clockspring requires the driver to manually cancel the turn signal upon completion
                    of the turn. To convert to a non-canceling assembly remove the canceling hub by gently pulling and
                    rocking the hub to disengage the three locking tabs. See figure 14.
