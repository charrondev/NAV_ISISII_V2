                <para>Reports have been received that repeated door closings on the above models can produce cracking of
                    the upper rear door opening along the drip rail. In extreme cases, cracking may continue down the
                    glamour edge of the opening from the drip rail. See
                    <hotlnk xrefid="f0216051">Figure 1</hotlnk>. This process is to be applied only to those cabs,
                    driver and/or passenger sides that exhibit any of these cracks.
