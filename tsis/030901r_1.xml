                <para>The 8600 utilizes double-sided tape along the upper edge of the grille to prevent the grille from
                    warping when exposed to high temperatures. The tape is applied in the assembly plant and fully cures
                    in three days. Removal of the grille after the tape adhesive cures, without damaging the grille, can
                    be difficult, particularly in cold weather. This TSI is being revised to update the size and
                    configuration of the double-sided tape.

                    <para>To prevent vehicle damage and personal injury, park the vehicle on a level surface, set the
                        parking brake, chock the wheels, and turn the engine off.

                <para count="1">Place the vehicle in a warm environment. Heat helps to reduce the adhesion forces of the

            <step1>
                <para count="1">Open the hood and apply heat to underside of the hood for 3-4 minutes. Make certain that
                    the heat is applied where the hood overlaps with the top of the grille. Too much heat will discolor
                    the hood and/or grille. Keep the heat gun moving. See Figure 1 for approximate location of tape.

                    grille about the upper edge where it meets the hood. Since the tape has such high retaining force, a
                    minimum of two people lifting is recommended to maintain an even force across the bottom of the
                    grille. Pull slowly!
