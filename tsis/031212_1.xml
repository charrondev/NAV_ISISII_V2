                <para>This TSI applies to vehicles built prior to November 2002 (2002 Emissions).</para>
                <para>The service part radiator for the 2000, 5000, 9000 models is now Aluminum instead of Copper Brass.
                    The core has been changed to Aluminum in order to accommodate the higher horsepower applications.
                </para>
                <para>On the Copper Brass radiator there are two support rods on the front and back sides of the
                    radiator that run from the top of the radiator to the bottom for added strength. See Figure 1. The
                    Aluminum radiators do not require these four support rods so DO NOT attempt to transfer the support
                    rods from the old radiator to the new radiator.
                </para>
                <para>When installing the aluminum radiator it is important to replace the four rubber isolators that go
                    between the radiator and the frame. When ordering the replacement radiator, the parts list will
                    advise you if you need to order the isolators separately. If no additional parts are required, then
                    the isolators should be supplied with the replacement radiator.
