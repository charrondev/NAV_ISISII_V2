                <para>Due to certain conditions, which can only be met prior to or during initial seat belt
                    installation, self-retracting seat belt assemblies can experience what is known as "Reverse
                    Lock-up". When it occurs, the belt cannot be pulled out of the retractor and appears to be "locked".
                    This condition is either caused by excessive webbing spooled into the retractor before it is
                    installed into the vehicle or the belt retractor not being in the vertical position. The seat belts
                    in International Trucks are a part of a critical occupant protection system. The individual
                    components of these safety belt systems are carefully designed, factory calibrated and tested to
                    meet exacting Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. Follow the procedures to assure continued
                    compliance.
