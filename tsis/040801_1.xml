                <para>TSI-03-08-02 contained the operating instructions for the new RKE systems installed in the 9000i
                    Model Series built after January 31, 2003. With the introduction of the new system, it was
                    discovered that some vehicles exhibit a slight glow in the Parking Brake Indicator Lamp when the
                    parking brake is not applied. The glow may not be noticed during daylight but can be seen when the
                    cab is dark. This glow does not affect the operation of the vehicle parking braking system or RKE.
                    If a customer complains of the glow in the Parking Brake Indicator Lamp and the vehicle meets the
                    above parameters, performing the following procedure will eliminate the Parking Brake Indicator Lamp
                    glow.
