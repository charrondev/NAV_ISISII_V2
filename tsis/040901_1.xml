                <para>Some 8600 Models built between June 2, 2003 to September 18, 2003, may develop a small stress
                    crack, 1 to 4 inches long, in the area of the center, underside, hood reinforcement near the air
                    intake. This is a cosmetic crack and will not affect the long term durability of the hood. The crack
                    is caused by a flow line that was formed during the manufacture of the reinforcement. Follow the
                    Service Procedure to repair and prevent the crack from propagating.
