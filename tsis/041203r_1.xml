                <para>A new 1/4 inch NPTF thread turbocharger oil connector assembly (part number 1850084C91 - connector
                    and O-ring) has been released. This correctly mounts the flexible turbocharger oil supply tube to
                    the oil cooler header. This new connector assembly is to be used on diesel engines with serial
                    numbers 931164 through 1452885, (excluding the diesel engines listed in the note). The 1/4 inch NPTF
                    thread oil connector is available separately or in the updated turbocharger oil supply tube kit
                    (part number 1842907C92). Refer to instruction sheet part number 1171819R2, within the kit, for
                    correct installation procedure.

                    turbocharger oil supply tube kit (part number 1842907C92) has been released. The updated kit added
                    the 1/4 inch NPTF turbocharger oil connector assembly. Depending on engine application, either the
                    1/4 inch NPTF connector assembly or the oil fitting assembly will be used (not both).
