                <para>This TSI Letter applies to all models (bus, truck or stripped chassis) that can be ordered with an
                    Allison transmission. There is a change in fluid specifications for certain Allison Transmission
                    product families regardless of the model truck or bus it is installed in. The Donax TG fluid that
                    Shell is currently supplying to our assembly plants meets the new Allison TES-389 spec. The current
                    Donax TG fluid will be renamed to Donax TA-389. Dexron III is no longer available as of 01/01/2007
                    due to a licensing agreement . Refer to attached Allison document for product compatibility.
