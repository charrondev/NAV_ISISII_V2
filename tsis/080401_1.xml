                <para>The purpose of this document is to provide detailed troubleshooting information for the Spring
                    Assist Hydraulic Release (SAHR) Parking Brake system used in the Full Power Brakes System. This
                    information is to be used in conjunction with the Full Power Brakes service manual, and the TOOLBOX&#8482;
                    diagnostic program.

            <para>Troubleshooting the Full Power Brakes System begins with reviewing any brake related Diagnostic
                Trouble Codes (DTC's), using the TOOLBOX&#8482; diagnostic program. While the TOOLBOX&#8482; program
                provides adequate repair instructions for most DTC's, the following SAHR related DTC's may require the
                supplemental information provided in this document. The procedures in this document assume that the
                SERVICE PARK BRAKE indicator is lit and ALL other brake related DTC's have been resolved.
