                <para>The function of an engine idle shutdown feature on all electronic engines is to limit excessive
                    idle time by shutting down the engine after a specified time. This is NOT a turbo cool down feature,
                    so the ignition key must remain in the RUN position.
                </para>
                <para>The idle shutdown time is programmable and can be specified by the customer when ordering the
                    vehicle, or by an authorized dealer.

                        <para>The engine idle shutdown feature shuts down ONLY THE ENGINE, not the power to the rest of
                            the vehicle, which can result in run down batteries if the vehicle is left unattended for an
                            extended period of time.

                <para>The following information explains how the engine idle shutdown feature functions on Caterpillar
                    3176, 3406B PEEC, Cummins Celect and Detroit Diesel Series 60 electronically controlled engines.

            <para>The idle shutdown timer may be programmed for three (3) to sixty (60) minutes in one (1) minute

                be programmed so that this feature does, or does not work during PTO operation. All Series 60 vehicles
                have two (2) switches on the parking brake, one for the idle shutdown timer, and one to determine
                whether to use cruise control or PTO logic.
