                        <para>Lubrication of the latch will greatly reduce the effort required to open the latch. As a
                            result, if the latch is still difficult to operate, the door is probably locked. If the
                            operator continues to attempt to open the door, when locked, the adjustable rods may bend.
                            These rods require 125 lbs. of force to permanently bend the ends of the rods. A force
                            greater than 100 lbs. will flex the end of the rod and may cause the spring clip to pop
                            loose.
