            <para>Introduction of fluids other than brake fluid in the master cylinder will result in the swelling and
                deterioration of rubber parts, leading to reduced brake performance and eventual failure of the brake
                system. Brake failure might result in personal injury.

            <para>A Caution label has been added to the master cylinder (in addition to embossed wording in the master
                cylinder reservoir cover) noting that the brake system uses only brake fluid.

            <para>To avoid putting the wrong fluid in the master cylinder (contaminating the system), the following
