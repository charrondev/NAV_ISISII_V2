                <para>The function of the International 3 + 1 battery system is to isolate the three engine cranking
                    batteries from an auxiliary deep cycle battery when the engine is off. The auxiliary deep cycle
                    battery supplies nearly all vehicle electrical loads except for engine cranking. The engine can be
                    started even though the auxiliary battery has been discharged due to such loads as electric blanket
                    use, refrigerators, TVs, lights inadvertently left on, etc.

            <para>When the engine is turned off, the isolated battery 7-volt magnetic switch opens, isolating the
                auxiliary battery from the cranking batteries. Any accessories connected directly to the auxiliary
                battery continue to operate. In addition, placing the key switch in the "ACC" or "RUN" position closes
                the accessory 12-volt magnetic switch* supplying auxiliary battery power to any key switch controlled
                accessories. When the engine is started, the alternator "R" terminal output of 7 volts closes the
                isolated battery 7-volt magnetic switch. This connects all 4 batteries in parallel. The alternator can
                now charge all 4 batteries as well as supply power to all vehicle loads. (See circuit diagram - standard
