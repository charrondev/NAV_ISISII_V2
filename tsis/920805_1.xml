                    switches on the Motorola 86mm electronic speedometer/odometer instrument. The third chart (

                    and

                    program the tachometer.
                </para>
                <para>The two charts for the speedometer/odometer include the instructions and formulas for calculating
                    the pulses per mile number. This number is used to locate the appropriate binary code in the charts.

                    <note>
                        <para>The pulses/mile number is based on tire revolutions per mile. When tire revolutions are
                            stated in revolutions per kilometers, the kilometers must first be converted into miles
                            (kilometers x 0.6214 = miles).
                        </para>

                    used with medium-to-heavy-duty trucks are listed.
                </para>
                <para>The two charts for the speedometer/odometer are divided into three columns. The first column
                    (Pulses/Mile) lists the number of pulses generated by the magnetic sensor for each mile the vehicle
                    travels. The Pulses/Mile number is used to locate the appropriate binary code. The second column
                    (Binary Code) lists the binary code associated with the Pulses/Mile number. The binary code is used
                    to set the DIP switches.
                </para>
                <para>The speedometer/odometer instrument is designed with two DIP switches. One is an 8-segment DIP
                    switch used to program the speedometer function, and the other is a 10-segment DIP switch used to
                    program the odometer function. However, since both speedometer and odometer functions are activated
                    by electrical pulses generated by the same sensor, the same Pulses/Mile number must be used to
                    determine the DIP switch setting for both functions.
                </para>
                <para>The third column (Freq) lists a number representing the frequency of a test signal that can be
                    used to check the DIP switch settings. See "
                    <hotlnk xrefid="x9208052">Checking Speedometer and Odometer DIP Switch Settings</hotlnk>" section

            <title>TACHOMETER INFORMATION</title>
            <para>The information in this section covers the 0-3000 RPM Motorola 86mm programmable tachometers. The
                tachometer processes signals generated by the teeth on a rotating flywheel. The number of teeth on the
                flywheel determines the binary code used to program (calibrate) the tachometer. The chart (
                <hotlnk xrefid="f920805c">Figure 12</hotlnk>
                and
                <hotlnk xrefid="f920805d">Figure 13</hotlnk>) lists the more commonly used flywheels in terms of the
                number of teeth the flywheels have.
            </para>
            <para>The chart is divided into three columns. The first column lists numbers which represent the number of
                teeth on the flywheel. The second column lists the corresponding 8-digit binary code used to set the DIP
                switch to program the tachometer.
            </para>
            <para>The third column lists a number representing the frequency of a test signal that can be used to check
                the DIP switch settings.
            </para>
            <para>
                <title>A. PROGRAMMING THE TACHOMETER</title>
            </para>
            <para>First determine the number of teeth on the flywheel. Locate this number in the first column of the
                tachometer chart and note the binary code in the second column. Set the DIP switch to match this binary
                code. See "
                <hotlnk xrefid="x9208054">Setting DIP Switches to Binary Code</hotlnk>" section for instructions.
            </para>
            <para>
                <title>B. CHECKING DIP SWITCH SETTING</title>
            </para>
            <para>The third column of the chart lists a test signal frequency for each binary code listed. This test
                signal can be applied to the tachometer to check whether the DIP switch has been properly set to the
                binary code.
            </para>
            <para>For example, a 1716 Hertz test signal is listed for the binary code 01010010 (103 teeth on the
                flywheel). When the 1716 Hertz test signal is applied to a tachometer properly programmed for 01010010,
                the tachometer pointer will deflect to the 1000 RPM mark on the dial.
            </para>
            <specpara>
                <note>
                    <para>Doubling and tripling the test signal will deflect the tachometer pointer to 2000 and 3000 RPM
                        respectively.
