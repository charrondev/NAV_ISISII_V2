                <para>This TSI describes a systematic inspection procedure that is to be performed to alleviate
                    unnecessary replacement of the cylinder head gasket due to misdiagnosed causes such as external oil,
                    coolant or combustion gas leakage.
                </para>
                <para>Any fluids that are leaked or spilled on the front or top of the engine have a tendency to collect
                    in the crankcase/cylinder head gasket joint area and subsequently result in no-fault cylinder head
                    gasket replacement.
                </para>
                <para>Typically fluids light enough in viscosity run freely and appear to be leaking from the front or
                    rear corners of the crankcase/cylinder head joint area.
                </para>
                <para>Fluids of heavier viscosity sometimes remain in the crankcase/cylinder head joint area and either
                    type of fluid can saturate the head gasket body material. These fluids during normal engine
                    operation/vibration and thermal induced motion cause small bubbles to form which expand and collapse
                    at varying frequency depending on engine speed. (Refer to

                    <para>Since the head gasket is very seldom the cause of leak concerns, it is recommended that a
                        thorough cleaning of the engine and/or suspected area should be performed in order to ascertain
                        the location and/or cause of the concern prior to any head gasket replacement.

            <para>The cause of these bubbles has been identified as engine oil, diesel fuel, power steering fluid and
                glycol/antifreeze. Any spillage or leakage of these fluids on the engine will drain along the head
                gasket joint and will be trapped at the edge of the gasket material. On a cold engine, the bubbles may
                not be evident. During engine operation small soap-like bubbles develop and burst due to heat and joint
                motion. The higher the engine speed the more rapid this bubbling occurs.
            </para>
            <para>This phenomenon is caused by joint motion between cylinder head and crankcase and requires an external
                source of fluids.
            </para>
            <para>Engineering testing and examination of these gaskets reveals that no combustion gases have escaped the
                combustion seals of these gaskets.
