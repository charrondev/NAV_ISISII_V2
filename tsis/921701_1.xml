            <para>This procedure can be used on either steer or drive axles. The bearing must be fully installed before
                checking end play (cotter key installed or jam nut jammed). Use a dial indicator to measure hub end play
                with respect to the spindle or axle tube. Mount the dial indicator at the bottom of the wheel (remove
                hub cap or axle shaft), or on the drum or hub as illustrated in
                <hotlnk xrefid="f9217017">Figure 7</hotlnk>. Grasp drum, hub or tire at the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock
                position (
                <hotlnk xrefid="f9217017">Figure 7</hotlnk>). First push, then pull evenly on the drum, hub or tire to
                measure the amount of end play. Note total indicator reading.
