                <para>This TSI applies to 3900FC model chassis with hydraulic brakes built before December, 1992.</para>
                <para>To assist in new brake pad burnishing (break-in), subject model chassis brake pads were faced with
                    a slurry. The slurry assures that sufficient heat is generated to provide proper burnish of the
                    brake friction material. At low mileage, as the brakes seat-in and as the slurry wears away, a
                    cracking or crazing of the slurry occurs. This cracking or crazing is in the slurry only and does
                    not extend down into the brake friction material. Slurry is no longer required and is not present on
                    units built after December, 1992.

                    <hotlnk xrefid="f9304051">Figure 1</hotlnk>. Additionally, a step may be visible between the base
                    material and the slurry at the edge of the pad. The amount of slurry remaining may be determined
                    from the thickness of this step.
                </para>
                <para>Low mileage brake pads should
                    <emph type="bold">NOT</emph>
                    be replaced for this cracking or crazing. The slurry and any associated crazing will disappear as
                    the brake friction material seats-in.
