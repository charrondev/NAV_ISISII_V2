                <para>This TSI applies to 2000, 4000, and 8000 Series vehicles with air conditioning.</para>
                <para>The air conditioning drip tray in some 2000, 4000 and 8000 Models may be mounted incorrectly,
                    causing the tray to become twisted, allowing water to drip onto the floor of the cab. If this
                    condition exists, the following procedure will correct the condition.

                <para count="1">Remove the screws that hold the lower right instrument panel in place, and remove the
                    panel along with the drip tray. On the backside of the panel are two pins molded into the panel.
                    These two pins go into two holes on the edge of the air conditioning drip tray. The tray is held in
                    place by a tinnerman clip on each pin. The reason the drip tray twists out of shape which allows
                    water to drip on the cab floor is because the two holes in the edge of the drip pan are located
                    incorrectly.

                    part. Carefully remove the tinnerman clips from the pins because rough handling may cause the pins
                    to break off.
