                <para>9200, 9300 and 9400 Model vehicles equipped with "Nav Air" cab air suspension are shipped with a
                    block installed between the cab suspension track bar assembly and the cab suspension lower plate as
                    illustrated in
                    <hotlnk xrefid="f9316121">Figure 1</hotlnk>. The block is held in position by the weight of the cab
                    and a plastic stay strap. The shipping block is installed in this position to prevent the cab from
                    moving during shipping.

                <para>Before demonstrating or delivering vehicles equipped with cab air suspension, the shipping block
                    MUST BE REMOVED. Cut the plastic stay strap, lift up on the cab with a pry bar in an area close to
                    the block and remove the block. Vehicles demonstrated or delivered with the block in position will
                    not benefit from the cab air suspension.
                </para>
                <para>Cab air suspension ride height for 92/93/9400 model vehicles is 7-3/4 inches. How to measure is
                    illustrated in
                    <hotlnk xrefid="f9316122">Figure 2</hotlnk>.
