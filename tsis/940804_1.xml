                <para>This TSI describes the adding of ground clips to ground the speedometer and tachometer gauges.
                </para>
                <para>When static electricity results in false movement (sweeping) of the speedometer and tachometer,
                    ground clips can be added to ground the speedometer and tachometer gauges to the housing. All 9000
                    vehicles built after January 1, 1994 will have the ground clips installed.
