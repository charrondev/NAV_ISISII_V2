                        <para>This bulletin is being issued in order to provide a general assistance guide to those in
                            the field that are faced with the day-to-day responsibility of maintaining and replacing
                            v-ribbed belts (Dayco Poly Rib&#174;) used in the heavy vehicle industry today. Since the
                            somewhat recent introduction of serpentine as well as single v-ribbed belt drives for heavy
                            duty vehicles a few years ago, there may be some confusion as to when to replace the
                            v-ribbed belt and what is causing the need for possible replacement. This bulletin has been
                            designed to assist those who may have such concerns.
                        </para>
                        <para>The normal cause for v-ribbed belt replacement is caused by rib rubber fatigue, which is a
                            natural occurrence and is known as "rib cracking". Beyond "rib cracking" there exists
                            several other reasons to replace the drive belt.

                            <para>When the ribs appear to have a shiny surface that is hard and brittle, it is usually
                                an indication of belt slippage. This is attributed to inadequate tension and/or extreme
                                temperature. Both characteristics will lead to severe cracking and failure often with
                                little advance warning. If this happens, locate the cause and correct before installing
                                a new belt.
