                    <para>To provide satisfactory service life, the procedure for welding transverse torque rods to rear
                        axle housings must be followed. The following welding information will aid a welder in providing
                        a commercial quality weld for truck applications.

                    <para>All welding on axle housings must be done by welders certified by an independent testing
                        laboratory to meet the requirements of AWS D1.1 Structural Welding Code.

                            <para>Invisible ultraviolet and infrared rays emitted in welding can injure unprotected eyes
                                and skin. Protection such as welder's helmet with dark colored filter lenses of the
                                proper density must be used. GTAW or TIG welding will produce intense radiation,
                                therefore, filter plate lenses of the deepest shade providing adequate visibility are
                                recommended. It is strongly recommended that persons working in the weld area wear flash
                                safety goggles. Also wear protective clothing.

                        avoid excessive welding.
