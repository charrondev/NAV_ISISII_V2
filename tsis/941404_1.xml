            <title>PROPER IDENTIFICATION AND GEAR PATTERN FOR THE NEW SPICER "CONTINUOUS INDEX" CUT GEAR SETS FOR W230-S
                (CODE 14057) AND W460-S (CODE 14474) REAR AXLES

            <para>Spicer Bulletin No. 62, dated 10-25-1994</para>
            <para>Due to today's production requirements, Spicer Heavy Axle has phased in ring and pinion gear sets that
                use different manufacturing methods than the conventional gear sets.
            </para>
            <para>The new sets are called
                <emph type="bold">"Continuous Index Cut Gears."</emph>
                The new gear sets are a direct replacement for the conventional cut gears, therefore it was not
                necessary to assign new part numbers for the matched sets. The "Continuous Index" gear sets do, however,
                require building with a different tooth contact pattern than the conventional gear sets, so positive
                identification was necessary to distinguish continuous index gear sets from the conventional.
            </para>
            <para>The individual Continuous gears were assigned new part numbers that will be used to properly identify
                them. The first 5 digits of the pinion gear part number are 057GP, followed by a 3 number suffix to
                indicate ration. The first 5 digits of the ring gear part number are 057GR. The illustration (
                <hotlnk xrefid="f9414041">Figure 1</hotlnk>) shows location of individual part numbers.

                    <para>If matched sets are being reused, measure and record backlash before disassembly, and
                        reassemble to the same backlash. This will match ring and pinion gears to the established wear
                        patterns. Hand rolled patterns of pre-used gear sets will cover less area than the wear pattern
                        established by previous service.
