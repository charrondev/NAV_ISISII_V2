                            regulations concerning concealed damages have been set forth in the Interstate Commerce
                            Commission's ruling under Ex Parte 263, and item 300135 of the carrier's classification
                            states, in part, "It is incumbent upon the consignee to offer reasonable evidence to the
                            carrier's representative when inspection is made that loss or damage was not incurred by the
                            consignee after delivery of shipment by carrier."
