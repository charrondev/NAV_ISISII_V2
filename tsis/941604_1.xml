                <para>If a complaint of unsatisfactory air conditioning cooling is received on a 2000, 8000, 9600 or
                    9700 Model with a Cummins M11 engine, the condition may exist because the heater hoses are reversed
                    at the engine. Check to be sure the heater hoses are not reversed at the engine. If the hoses are
                    reversed, hot water will flow through the heater core all the time, greatly affecting air
                    conditioning performance. For proper operation of the heater system, the 3/4 inch hose should be on
                    the outside fitting (2000, 8000) or valve (9600, 9700) and the 5/8 inch hose on the inside fitting
                    (2000, 8000) or valve (9600, 9700) as illustrated in

                <para>If after inspection the hoses are found reversed, lower the cooling system coolant level and
                    reverse the hoses and fittings on 1000 and 8000 Models, and the hoses and shut off valves on 9600
                    and 9700 Models.
