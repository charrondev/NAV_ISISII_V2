                <para>On all 9200, 9300 and 9400 Series vehicles built after June 1, 1994, complaints may be received
                    concerning bumping or squeaking sounds coming from the hood area. These sounds are most likely the
                    result of the hood vibrating and contacting the cowl. Also complaints of hood vibration and flutter
                    may be received. These complaints are most likely due to the rear edge of the hood being too close
                    to the cowl and/or an incorrect hood height adjustment. These conditions should be corrected for
                    driver comfort and to prevent continued wear between the hood and cowl.
