            <para>An incorrect procedure has been identified in Service Manuals EGES 105 and EGES 105-1 for the DT-408,
                DT-466 and the International&#174; 530 diesel engines. Section 6, pages 26 and 27 specify the use of
                lubriplate for lubricating the cylinder sleeve O-Rings and crankcase lower counterbore prior to sleeve
                installation. This practice could lead to problems described below. Refer to the next sections for
                service manual corrections. Replace these corrected sections in your service manuals and advise all
                service technicians of the correct procedure.

                Lubriplate and grease have thick consistencies and are

                able to escape from between the O-Rings during sleeve installation. Use of lubriplate or grease can
                result in a grease bound condition between the O-Rings thereby causing the sleeve to distort and lead to
                cylinder scoring.

            <para>Difficult sleeve insertion into the lower counterbore is an indication of incorrect size, twisted, out
                of position or lubrication bound O-Rings. The sleeves should install by hand without extreme effort. If
                difficult sleeve insertion is encountered or there is any question of distortion at the lower
                counterbore area, inspection of the sleeve bore with a dial bore indicator is recommended. Out of round
                or tapered condition beyond specified limits is not acceptable and can cause cylinder scoring. If any of
                these conditions are encountered the sleeve must be removed and the cause of distortion corrected.
