            <para>The old flywheel mounting bolts,
                <hotlnk xrefid="f9512091">P/N 1 817 846 C1</hotlnk>
                have been replaced with new flywheel mounting bolts,
                <hotlnk xrefid="f9512091">P/N 1 823 929 C1.</hotlnk>
                Effective on all DT 408, DT 466 and International 530 diesel engines equipped with manual transmissions
                having S/N 949442 and Above. All DT 466E diesel engines are also affected. The new bolt head has been
                reduced in height, increasing the clearance between the bolt head and the clutch disc hub. This
                eliminates the possibility of the flywheel mounting bolt heads rubbing against the clutch disc hub after
                the flywheel has been resurfaced. The new flywheel mounting bolts are tightened to 136 Nm (100 lb.-ft.).

                <note>
                    <para>It is recommended to replace the old flywheel mounting bolts with new flywheel mounting bolts
                        the first time the flywheel is removed from the engine assembly.
