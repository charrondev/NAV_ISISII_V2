                <para>Effective October 1996, the Spicer Life Series SPL-170 and SPL-250 propeller shafts will become
                    available on 2000, 8000 and 9000 Models. Features include permanently lubricated slip joint and
                    extended lubrication cycle for the U-joint (100,000 miles in line-haul applications). U-Joint Kit
                    bearing and seal designs have been improved for extended service life.
                </para>
                <para>During scheduled maintenance, it is important to recognize the SPL series from greaseable
                    propeller shafts to prevent premature failure due to lack of lubrication.

                </para>
                <para>SPL-170 and SPL-250 propeller shafts have a boot over the slip spline and no grease zerk (
                    <hotlnk xrefid="f9606011">Figure 1</hotlnk>). The factory grease fill is permanent and does not need
                    to be replenished. The U-joint has a zerk fitting and is to be lubricated at 100,000 mile intervals
                    for line-haul applications and 25,000 miles for off-highway and city service, following the
                    recommendations in Group 10 - LUBRICATION in the CTS-5000 Master Service Manual. Additionally, the
                    stamped bearing straps have been replaced with machined bearing straps for increased durability (
                    <hotlnk xrefid="f9606012">Figure 2</hotlnk>). Strap mounting bolts are tightened to 100 to 120
                    ft-lbs. (135 to 160 Nm) of torque. The spring straps on tube yokes are tightened to 25 to 30 ft-lbs.
                    (35 to 40 Nm) of torque (
                    <hotlnk xrefid="f9606013">Figure 3</hotlnk>).
