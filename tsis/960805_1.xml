                <para>Operator rapid re-engagement of the cranking motor will cause damage to the flywheel ring gear and
                    possibly the cranking motor. Vehicles equipped with non-electronic automatic transmissions are more
                    likely to have ring gear damage due to operators shifting from "D" through "N" to "R" then back to
                    "N" with starter button depressed. When this occurs, the starter is activated when the ring gear is
                    rocking back off a compression stroke and a portion of the ring gear may be chipped.
                </para>
                <para>To prevent damage to the flywheel ring gear created by rapid re-engagement of the cranking motor,
                    there is now available a "Starter Re-engagement Delay Module" (
                    <hotlnk xrefid="f9608051">Figure 1</hotlnk>). The module will not affect the initial operation of
                    the cranking system in any way. However, if the operator discontinues cranking and then quickly
                    attempts to re-initiate cranking, the module will not allow re-engagement of the cranking system for
                    two or three seconds (giving the ring gear sufficient time to come to a complete stop), thus
                    preventing ring gear damage from starter re-engagement.
