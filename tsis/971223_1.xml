                <para>The engine electrical harness assembly (P/N 1815923C92 for T 444E engines (
                    <hotlnk xrefid="f9712231">Figure 1</hotlnk>) and 1807285C92 for DT 466E/530E Engines [
                    <hotlnk xrefid="f9712232">Figure 2</hotlnk>]) located under the valve cover (UVC) has been revised.
                    The harness connector seal at the injectors was removed. The seal is no longer required for
                    production use; it was never a serviceable part.
                </para>
                <para>The seal was eliminated in production during model year 1995 as a running change. The seal is not
                    required for any engine in service. Function is the same with or without the seal. Do not replace
                    UVC harness because of a missing seal.
