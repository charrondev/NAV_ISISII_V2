                        <para>The latest release of the above PDL control systems went into production August, 1996 at
                            Chatham and October, 1996 at Springfield.

                </specpara>
                <para>Prior to this change, all tandem axle manufacturers could have used either PDL control system. To
                    determine which type PDL control system is used, compare the PDL cover design and location of the
                    air input port to the examples shown in
