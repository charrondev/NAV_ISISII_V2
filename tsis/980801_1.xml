                <para>On certain vehicles, some of the vehicle electronics may require that power and ground to the
                    device go directly to the batteries. If the vehicle is so equipped, at the battery box you will see
                    the normal heavy positive and negative cables plus lighter gauge feed and ground circuit wires to
                    vehicle electronics.

                <para>Whenever performing electrical service which requires disconnecting vehicle batteries, follow the
                    procedure outlined below.

                        <para>Batteries expel explosive gases. Keep sparks, flames, burning cigarettes, or other
                            ignition sources away at all times. Always wear safety glasses and face shield when working
                            near batteries to prevent personal injury.
