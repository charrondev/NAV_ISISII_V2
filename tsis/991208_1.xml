                <title>Coolant Filter Header Assembly</title>
                <para>A new coolant filter header featuring a manual shut off valve will replace the existing filter
                    header that utilizes check valves to contain engine coolant whenever the filter is removed. This is
                    designed to minimize any potential loss of coolant when servicing the filter.

            </para>
            <para>The redesigned coolant filter header assembly has been released for use in all NGD I-6 diesel engines,
                replacing the existing coolant filter header assembly. The redesigned header assembly, located on the
                right side of the engine behind the front cover, will incorporate a manual shut off valve instead of the
                current filter header utilizing (2) check valves. This will aid service technicians by minimizing the
                possibility that the check valves may not seat properly, resulting in lost engine coolant.
            </para>
            <para>The new coolant filter header assembly (P/N 1827689C91) will replace the discontinued coolant filter
                header assembly (P/N 1820381C93, discontinued in both production and service parts). There will be no
                changes made to any existing related components such as bolts, gaskets, or the filter itself. This
                production change will occur with 1999 Model Year engines, bearing serial number 117199 and higher.
